Mic check
Come through, dig the sound
Crowd around

I used to cop a lot but never copped no drop
Hold mics like pony tails, tight and bob a lot
Stop and stick around, come through and dig the sound
Of the fly brown six-o sicko psycho who throws his dick around
Bound to go three-plat, came to destroy rap
It's a intricate plot of a B-boy strap
Femstats cats get kidnapped

Cats get kidnapped
Then release a statement to the press
Let the rest know who did that
Metal Face terrorists claim responsibility
Broken household name usually said in hostility
Um, what MF, you silly?
I'd like to take mens to the end for two milli'
"Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo" That's a audio daily double

Rappers need to fall off just to save me the trouble, yo
Watch your own back, came in and go out alone
Black stay in the zone, turn H2O to Cognac on Doomsday
Ever since the womb til I'm back where my brother went
That's what my tomb will say
Right above my government, Doom will lay
Either unmarked or engraved, hey, who's to say?
I wrote this one in B.C. D.C. O-section

If you don't believe me, go get bagged and check then
Cell number 17, up under the top bunk
I say this not to be mean, wish bad luck or pop junk
Pop the trunk on See-Cipher-Punk, leave him left scraped
God forbid, if there ain't no escape, blame MF tape
Definition "Super-villain" a killer who love children
One who is well-skilled in destruction, as well as building
While Sidney Sheldon teaches the trife to be trifler

I'm trading science fiction with my man the live lifer
A pied piper holler a rhyme, a dollar and a dime
Do his thing, ring around the white collar crime
Get out my face, askin' bout my case, need toothpaste
Fresher mint, monkey-style nigga get get metadent
And dope fiends still in they teens, shook niggas turn witness
Real mens mind their own business

That's the difference between sissy-pissy rappers
That's double-dutch
How come I hold the microphone double-clutch
C.O.'s make rounds, never have ox found
On shakedown, lock-down, wet dreams of Fox' Brown on Doomsday
Ever since the womb til I'm back where my brother went
That's what my tomb will say
Right above my government, Doom will lay

Either unmarked or engraved, hey, who's to say?
Doomsday
Every since the womb til I'm back to the essence
Read it off the tomb
Either engraved or unmarked grave, who's to say?
Pass the mic like, "Pass the peas like they used to say"
Some M-er F-ers don't like how Sally walk
I'll tell y'all  fools it's hella cool how ladies from Cali talk

Never let her interfere with the Yeti ghetto slang
Nicknames, metal fang
([Unverified], off nipple and tip of nipples)
Known amongst hoes for the bang-bang
Known amongst foes for flow with no talking orangutans
Only gin and Tang, guzzled out a rusty tin can
Me and this mic is like yin and yang

Clang, crime don't pay, listen, youth
It's like me holding up the line at the kissing booth
I took her back to the truck, she was uncouth
Spittin' all out the sunroof, through her missing tooth
But then she has a sexy voice, sound like Jazzy Joyce

So I turned it up faster than a speeding knife
Strong enough to please a wife
Able to drop today's math in the 48 keys of life
Cut the crap far as rap
Touch the mic, get the same thing a Arab will do to you for stealing
What the devil? He's on another level
It's a word, no, a name, MF,  the super-villain

Doomsday
Dig the sound
Crowd around


Keep your hoes in check
Super

I got this girl and she wants me to duke her
I told her I'd come scoop her around eight, she said, "Super"
That sounds great, shorty girl's a trooper
No matter what I need her to do, she be like, Super

Own his own throne, the boss like King Koopa
On the microphone he flossed the ring, super
Average emcees is like a TV blooper
MF Doom, he's like D.B. Cooper

Out with the moolah, I let her get a outfit
Just to cool her off, she said, Niggaz ain't about shitâ€
I wonder if she meant it, I doubt it
The way it be in her mouth, she can't live without it

And can't live with this, handle your business
Villain'll stay on a scandalous hoes shit list
One pack of cookies please, Mr. Hooper
It's fun smackin' rookies, he is the super

Look like a black wookie when he let his beard grow
Weirdo, brown, skinned and always kept his hair low
Rumors has it, it's a S-curl accident
Doom was always known to keep the best girls' backs bent

Some say it's the eyes, some say the accent
A lotta guys wonder where they stacks went
I call her thunder thighs with the fatty swolla
Only mess with high rollers, do what daddy told her

No matter the city, she want me to do the thang, thang
Work in the coochie, hooptie, chitty, chitty, bang, bang
Same name on the titty as on the name ring
Pretty like Baby D of  'All In The Same Gang'

Keep my eye on her, really don't trust her
But I treat her like a daughter, taught her how to bust a nut
And the heat to turn beef to horsemeat, chalupa
Teach her how to hold it, of course he is the super

See most cats treat her like foofer
Or beat her to a stupor, take it from the super
You need to make her feel cuter
And lay down the G like Luther, everything will be super

Do for her, keep her in a new fur
So she look sweet when she go to meet the super
Got the buddha, get the Grenadiers, twist it
Put it in the air, come here, kiss it

Listen here, scooter, let her try to bag you
When she's on the rag never let her fry the Ragu
Which will have you under some type of spell, crying, Dag boo
Her name on your back in her tattoo

Whether a bourgie broad, nerd hoe, street chick
Don't call her wifey if you met her at the freaknick
You don't want her, don't waste her time, I'll dupe her
And be a father to your child like the super

He keep his hoes in check
Sends 'em out to get glows from off frozen necks
Tell 'em take his clothes, leave him posin' nekkid for real
Better yet, get 'em for the check off the record deal

Find out where he keep the tek and the blue steel
Make sure for extra wreck, let 'em know how you feel
And while he's runnin down to All-Star Weekend to ball
I'm comin with the U-haul, super

Super, super


Beef rap could lead to gettin' teeth capped
Or even a wreath for mom dukes on some grief crap
I suggest you change your diet
It can lead to high blood pressure if you fry it

Or even a stroke, heart attack, heart disease
It ain't no startin' back once arteries start to squeeze
Take the easy way out, phony, until then they know
They wouldn't be talkin' that bologna in the bullpen

So disgustin, pardon self as I discuss this
They talk a wealth of shit and they ain't never seen the justice
Bust this like a cold milk from out the toilet
Two batteries some Brillo and some foil, he'll boil it

He be better off on PC glued
And it's a feud so don't be in no TV mood
Every week it's mystery meat, seaweed stewed

He wears a mask just to cover the raw flesh
A rather ugly brother with flows that's gorgeous
Drop dead joints hit the whips like bird shit
They need it like a hole in they head or a third tit

Her bra smell, his card say, aw, hell
Barred from all bars and kicked out the Carvel
Keep a cooker where the jar fell
And keep a cheap hooker that's off the hook like Ma Bell

Top bleeding, maybe fellow took the loaded rod gears
Stop feeding babies colored, sugar coated lard squares
The odd pairs swears and God fears
Even when it's rotten, we've gotten through the hard years

I wrote this note around New Year's
Off a couple a shots and a few beers, but who cares
Enough about me, it's about the beats
Not about the streets and who food he about to eat

A rhymin' cannibal who's dressed to kill, it's cynical
Whether is it animal, vegetable or mineral
It's a miracle how he get so lyrical
And proceed to move the crowd like a old negro spiritual

For a mil' do a commercial for Mello Yello
Tell 'em devil's hell, no, sell y'all own Jello
We hollow krills, she swallow pills
He follow flea collar, three dollar bills

And squeal for halal veal, in y'all appeal
Dig the real, it's how the big ballers deal
Twirl a L after every meal

Word up to all rappers, shut up with ya shuttin' up
And keep your shirt on, at least a button up
Yuck, is they rhymers or strippin' males?
Outta work jerks since they shut down Chippendales

They chippin' nails, doom, chippin' scales
Let alone the pre-orders that's counted off shippin' sales
This one goes out to all my peoples skippin' bail
Dippin' jail, whippin' tail and sippin' ale

Light the doobie til it glow like a ruby
After which they couldn't find the villain like Scooby
He's in the lab on some old Buddha Monk shit
Overproof drunk shit and who'da thunk it

Punk, try and ask why ours be better
It could be the iron mask or the Cosby sweater
Yes, you, who's screwed by the dude on the CD nude


Yo, yo, MF Doom, Mr. Fantastik
Mr. Fantastik, the villain
What up, nigga? Ain't nuttin, what's the word?
What's cracking, boy? Same ol' shit, kid

Man, rap snitches, man
Shit is bugged out, man, the fuck, man
You telling me, niggaz running their mouth
Telling anything, anything

Rap snitches, tellin' all their business
Sit in the court and be their own star witness
Do you see the perpetrator? Yeah, I'm right here
Fuck around, get the whole label set up for years, huh

Rap snitches, tellin' all their business
Sit in the court and be their own star witness
Do you see the perpetrator? Yeah, I'm right here
Fuck around, get the whole label set up for years, huh

Type profile low, like they get paid in full
Attract heavy cash cuz the game's centrifugal
Mr. Fantastik, long though like elastic
Got my life between glocks, it's made out of plastic

Can't stand the brown nosin' nigga, fake ass bastard
Admiring my style so I bust through Manhattan
Plottin', plan the quickest, my flow is the sickest
My hoes be the thickest, my dro, the stickiest

Street nigga, stamped and bonafide
When beef jump niggaz come get me cuz they know I ride
Two to the ski mask, New York's my origin
Play a fake gangsta like a old accordion

Accordin' to him when the deed's rushed in
Complication from the wild testimony was thin
Caused his man to go up north, the ball hit 'em again
Blame rap snitch nigga, even told on the Mexican

Rap snitches, tellin' all their business
Sit in the court and be their own star witness
Do you see the perpetrator? Yeah, I'm right here
Fuck around, get the whole label set up for years, huh

Rap snitches, tellin' all their business
Sit in the court and be their own star witness
Do you see the perpetrator? Yeah, I'm right here
Fuck around, get the whole label set up for years

True, there's rules to this shit, fools dare care
Everybody wanna rule the world with tears for fear
Yeah, yeah, tell 'em, tell it on the mountain hill
Runnin' up they mouth bill, everybody doubtin' still

Informer, keep it up and get tested
Pop through the bubble vest or double breasted
He keep a lab down south in the little beast
So much heat you would've thought it was the Middle East

A little grease always keeps the wheels a spinnin'
Like sittin' on twenty threes to get the squeelers grinnin'
Hittin' on many trees, feel real linen
Spittin' on enemies, get the steel for tin men

With no brains but gum flap
He said his gun clap then he fled after one slap
Pat, son, shut your trap, save it for the bitches
Mmm, delicious, rap snitch knishes

You know what I'm saying? It's a terrible crazy, man
Just analyzing this whole game, it's just bugged out, man
Niggaz are snitching, telling on them own selves
It's a horror, man

Fuck around and get anybody bagged, man, trust us
Fuck around and get yo mama bagged, nigga
You know your grandmama used to be blegging
Fake hustling, nigga


Hot shit, aw shit, hot shit, aw shit
Hot shit, aw shit, hot shit
Hot shit, aw shit, hot shit, aw shit
Hot shit, aw shit

I strive to be humble lest I stumble, never sold a jumbo
Or copped chicken with its mumbo sauce
Tyson is a fowl holocaust
Hitler gassed your whole head up with poetry I'm fed up
Ignore Cordon Bleu, stand up, get up
Lunge for your knife; don't forget your potholderz

Hot shit, what? These old things? About to throw them away
With the gold rings that make 'em don't fit like O.J.
Usually I take them off with Oil of Olay
MC's is crabs in a barrel, pass the old bay

Hot as hell and it's a cold day in it
Working on a way that we go roll away tinted
Some say the price of holdin' heat is often too high
You either be in a coffin or you be the new guy

The one that's too fly to eat shoe pie, never too busy
Never too busy when it comes down to you and I
Swear to God, a lot of niggaz wish to die
They need to hold their horses, there's bigger fish to fry

You're on the list, if not pick a number spot
Ten and a half timbs is made to kick your bumbaclaat
I could have had a V-8
F-150 quad cab but I'll be straight

Money comes and goes like that two bit hussy
That night that tried to rush me, Dwight, pass the dutchie
So I can calm down so they don't get it twisted
Take it from the fire side it won't get blistered
Got it, what happened? Oh, it's not lit
These metal fingers be holding hot shit

When I was four I pen God was born in New York
Back in seventy seven still got nan in the crescent
The effervescence of God's presence is thick
Unlike vapor, escarole, extra roll, word to the baker
Peace to the hard workin' ginger bread makers

Looked her up and down, said, Hmm, too much makeup
Poor music taste, ten years from being grown up
Rappers don't blow up heads, do, aw shit

My name is Dwight Spits, I'm a Sonic addict
I use to think it was merely a nagging habit
Born under a bad sign, I'm serious about this curse of mine
I strive to flip it into fine wine

Barely born a virgin is what the stars said
Black not white, red all over though like Elmo
Twenty eight years have passed, I feel I'm peakin'
I make music every weekend

It's a chore, a fact of life, a labor of love
I get mad love but I detest the labor
And its wages, you know death
I'm servin' life on this gift of God
Don't forget your potholderz, my niggaz

Mo' hot
Mo' hot shit
Mo' hot shit


I get no kick from champagne
Their alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why shouldn't it be true?
I get a kick out of brew

There is only one beer left
Rappers screaming all in our ears like we're deaf
Tempt me, do a number on the label
Eat up all their MC's and drink 'em under the table

Like it's on me, put it on my tab, kid, however you get there
Foot it, cab it, iron horse it, you leaving on your face forfeit
I crush the mic hold it like the heat he might toss it
Told him tell they stole it, he told her he lost it
She told him get off it and a bunch other more shit

Getting money, DT's be getting no new leads
It's like he eating watermelon, stay spitting new seeds
It's the weed, give me some of what he's drooping off
Soon as he wake up choking like it was whooping cough

The group been soft, first hour at the open bar and their trooping off
He went to go laugh and get some head by the side road
She asked him to autograph her derriere, it read
To wide load, this yard bird taste like fried toad
Turned love villain take pride and code words

Crooked eye mold nerd geek with a cold heart
Probably still be speaking in rhymes as an old fart
Study how to eat, to dine by the pizza guy
No, he's not too fly to skeet in a skezzer eye

And squeeze her thigh, maybe giver her curves a feel
And the same way she feel it when she flow with nerves of steel
They call him super when they need their back or plumbing fixed
Powers only one left, the pack comes in six
Whatever happened to two and three

A hood tried to slide with four and five and got caught
Like, what you doing G?
Don't make 'em have to get cutting like truancy
Matter fact not for nothing right now you and me

Looser than a pair of Adidas, I hope you bought your spare tweeters
MC's sound like cheerleaders
Rapping and dancing like Red Head Kingpin
Dude, can we do this thing again no matter how be blinging

You do it for the smelly hubbies
Seeds know what time it is like it's time for Telletubbies
Few can do it, even fewer can sell it
Take it from the dude who wears mask like a tarded helmet

He plots shows like robberies
In and out, one, two, three, no bodies please
Run the cash and you won't get a wet sweatshirt
The mic is the shootie, nobody move, nobody get hurt

Bring heat, like the boy I'm going to war
Came in the door and everybody on the floor
A whole string of jobs like we are on tour
Every night on the score coming to your corner store


Tossing, turning, dreams of murder, someone's killing me
Of changes, there's nights I'm on a killing spree
All done, cold blood, waking up in cold sweats
This is such a cold world, unconscious getting death threats

Shadows choking me, my last breath lets out my body
It's a conspiracy, my mind and my body's not really down with me
Me against the whole world? It's a little deeper
Me against myself, I fight the Grim Reaper

Swing sickle and got my glock, bust rounds off
Demented, schizophrenic, I know this sounds off to you
I do not lie, when I doze off, spirits hope I die, whatever
Angels waste the time, they work together

Scheme and plot on me, 'cause I'm the son of man
I hear voices from a dog like Son of Sam
Don't give a damn if the bullets fill me
I don't wanna live, I hope they kill me

Put me out my misery, I live in misery
I kill all my enemies 'cause I live comfortably
Those who seek me are called wise men
Or either wise guys, I prey you comprehend
And realize I'm condemned

No rest, homicidal dreams
My cell mate, all he do is scream
Out loud, how he wants to go home
That's funny, I'm here all alone

Locked, in a single cell
His back's bleeding, he's cold as hell
And I'm hoping, they turn on some heat
I call the CO to bring some extra sheets

Where'd he go? he walk through walls, run halls, I prey, teach me
They don't see him at the health, try to reach me
I say, "Please, see how he feels"
They say, 'He's alright but he's not real"

Evaluations say I suffer from depression
Hallucinations, self-corration's what they're guessin'
I'm here doing years, I'm stressin'

Medicate me, sedate me, want me to rest an'
Don't take that won't be best an'
He said I need his help and he needs me
Nigga, you walk through walls, go home you're free

Home, that was far and he was turned off
'Cause his wings was burned off
A lesson was learned, communicate with one
I was chosen 'cause I'm God's son

And I'm the retarded one, out in the streets
You won't survive with wack ass beats
(We can see that)
These days and times
Watch as we get ours with rhymes

To my metal face bro's with stomach's of cast iron
Who been into when in blast to the last siren
On the slow-mo the calm artist with the so-so chick
Chased them all like Cairo did to Slobodan Milosovik

Anywho, how 'bout them Yankees
Once I leave, off-stage the party people thanks me's
If I may speak freely, nasty like the freaky-deeky
At your local sleazy speak-easy

Famely fan of the limelight
In the mic stand was a phallic stick of dynamite
It's risky business like hand to hand crack sale
With rappers who's better off on the cover of Black Tail

Jump into Jehosaphat who's that
Who cat's who do magic like, 'Tell me how you do's that'?
Heck no, especially those who cop pleas like gecko
Thought I might do techno

Ha ha, betcha bust out laughing at the bet
For no reason he get cussed out like Tourette
Yet tight flow to make her bad ass stutter
Or even crack a smile from a mad fast cutter

But ah, word play since third grade age
Back when we used to play 'Bang! Open bird cage'
Hip hop Benny Hill's to penny straight
Get every penny weight then he chill at any rate

My metal face hold with tongue release I-ring
Do yourself, I will continue to do my thing
Like Kung-Fu fighting everybody was biting
Then the super-villain struck again like lightening
In the same spot
(Buzz)

Now what's the chance of that?
And a name drop like pick the name out the hat
That's a known drop from the, liver-conniver
Who vote player out the rap game like Survive while I-ah

Drop through greens like a nerd cat wheeling ten speed
So way back spin your back and then freeze
While I play high-ball, low-ball, to zero
So called rhymers, go call Cleo

While I, steal the show like tho-so-try
Super duper stars need auto tri-cycling
Sometimes the men, mostly from the women
I hear voices saying that's the super-villain
(Uhn, I hear voices)
Mostly from the women, I hear voices, super-villain


Before we go any further, friends

As you call em they call you when they need somethin'
Trees for the blunt, two G's for the front
I found a way to get peace of mind for years and left the hell alone
Turn a deaf ear to the cellular phone

Send me a letter or better, we could see each other in real life
Just so you could feel me like a steel knife
At least so you could see the white of their eyes
Bright with surprise once they finish spittin' lies

Associates, is your boys, your girls, bitches, niggaz, homies?
Close, but really don't know me
Mom, dad, comrade, peeps, brothers, sisters, duns, dunnies
Some come around when they need some money

Others make us laugh like the Sunday funnies
Fam be around whether you paid or bummy
You could either ignore this advice or take it from me
Be too nice and people take you for a dummy

So nowadays he ain't so friendly
Actually they wouldn't even made a worthy enemy
Read the signs, no feeding the baboon
Seein' as how they got your back bleeding from the stab wounds

Y'all know the dance, they smile in your face, y'all know the glance
Try ta put 'em on, they blow the chance
Never let your so-called mans know your plans
How many of us have them? A show of hands

Friends is a term some people use loosely
I'm real choosy on what I choose to let crews see
You telling me, I try to act broke
Jealousy, the number one killer among black folk

Fellas be under some type of spell like crack smoke
Ghetto Cinderellas, lead 'em right to your stack, loc
Just another way a chick'll lead to your end
I check the dictionary for the meanin' of Friends'

It said, person, one who likes to socialize with
Sympathize and help her and that's about the size of it
Most of the time these attributes is one-sided
To bolster the crime they opt to shoot you through your eyelid

And they can't hide it goin' wild like a white bitch
Sometimes you need to cut niggaz off like a light switch
Click, and when things get quiet
Catch 'em like a thief in the night, bow, what a riot

I first met Mister Fantastik at a arms deal
Don't let it get drastic, think of how your moms will feel
When it get for real the steel get to sparkin'
Everything darken and ain't no talkin'

For somethin' so cheap it sure buys a lot of trouble
You better off focusing than tryin' to plot the bubble
Or else it'd be a sad note to end on, the guns we got
One's we can depend on, friends

Some come in the form of co-dependence
A lotta times only end up bein' co-defendants
Ten bucks say they'll tell for a lower sentence
And leave you up under the jail beggin' for a penance

It don't make no sense, what happened to the loyalty?
Honor amongst crooks, trust amongst royalty
I'd rather go out in a blaze, than give 'em the glory
How many of us have a similar story, friends?

Before lovers we used to have some type of over standing
Just so when I let her get the man-thing she know it's no strings
We could do the damn thing but, hoe, it's no rings
Just how the tramp swings, will she see 'em again?

That depends on how good was the skins
And could she memorize the lessons
It ain't no need to pretend
Even though she let 'em stab it, she know they just, friends

Friends, how many of us have them?
Friends, ones we can depend on?
Friends, how many of us have them?
Friends, before we go any further


Yeah, here we go, just go with the flow
Yeah, here we go, just go with the flow
Yeah, here we go, just go with the flow
Yeah, here we go, just go with the flow
Yo, I'd like to check this microphone before I start right quick
Microphone check 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2

Big up all the Monsta Island massive
And beware before I triple dare you like the last kid
Who ask me what we don't got that you got son
For one, flow that's elementary my dear Watson

Secondly, ever since I was little
Not so much to riddle, least rhyme to the syllable
Keep tracks that make a Arab thief clap
With no hands, I chop these drums off

Truly yours, G Rap
Actual fact, relax
In this land of lyrical loss, black
I'm not the cool sleet stack

The one who might stop and talk to you
Poison to few, niggas who be bitin' styles, I'm like pork to
Ooh, what you got to lose? Let mud fly
When I got blues I chew whole crews that's bud dry

So I ask why the style's from the cess
Shit be fuckin' with my eye as I pull it to the chest
The super muthafuckin' villain grip the mic wit an iron hand
Throwin' emcees to the fire from out da fryin' pan

It ain't no use in tryin', man
Son, stop cryin'
Frontin' like you death-defyin'
You need to stop lyin'

Speak your piece only once you're spoken to first
Now lemme hear your verse while I'm chokin' you
With bubbly fine rhymes like a editor
Throw them to my collection of skulls and spines like Predator

Fuck around, the only niggas who could hear the same sound
(Who?)
Was Jet Jaguar and James Brown
(Yeah, yeah, only them two niggas?)
And I'm glad I took the time to write their names down to big 'em up
(True, true)

I'd like to say hi
It's [unverified] fly the odd Merlin
That's quick to whip up a script like Rod Sterling
[Unverified] bad bitch who used to whip the Sterling

Who see God? Never see God earlin'
My man Grimm had his little monkey like Space Ghost
Me myself I got flavors that out-taste most
With numb gums, some rhymers is lake toast

Back to you MF Doom, you late show host
S to the U to the P E R, uh
Who chronicle these times in a 3-D horror
[Unverified] co-star or in a realer drama
Who break bread with stingy kin-men, Indian borrower

Lone gunmen who candidly flip fly floes
Single-handedly with one eye closed
In a fly pose, no shirt [unverified]
May see me stack the quarter-mill cash pay
That's in a smash way how he did it
Muthafucka probably couldn't peep it past a minute


Darker than the east river, larger than the Empire State
Where the beats to guard the barbed wire gate
Is on the job, not my fate, tired of the wait
To the villain bring deliverance from the Dire Straits

Fire at a higher rate, why'd they make the liars
Fliers scatter, buy a plate, isolate the wires
Try the straight pliers if not the vise grips
A real price saver way to acquire nice whips

What a steal for real on wheels of steel
Stunner a funner summer number one meal deal, bummer
A bizarre phenomenon is your armor on
Take your cash coma or break your fast, Ramadan

Trans action drama, aw, come on, Barney
Clack, clack, pardon me wack rap, Kon Karne
He came to feed the childrens like Sally Strothers
After that he's going back to Cali where's the love is

Wilder than the Nile, old power like the Great Pyramid of Giza
And stay leanin' like the tower of Pisa
Give him something he can feel that's off the squeeza
Raw with the pen and on the mic off the hezza

Get shot off that wide eye talk
If he had a pot he'd still piss on the sidewalk
Can't take the street out the street person
Looking for the perfect beat could worsen into heat bursting

They couldn't spot him on the spot date
Got the only tape that comes with a free hot plate
Whoever do get to see me sing
With the 3-D ring, sittin' stationary like B.B. King

Can see how it really sting, it ain't no front row
Standing room only at the motocross stunt show
The ruckus ain't up to snuffilufigus
Me and Sub is like the brown Smothers Brothers

My love is faster than the seven seas, bigger than mount Kilimanjaro
If they don't know fill them in tomorrow on the horror show
I'm into no return Bob's record
Swear to God before he gets a job he robs Hackard

Blessed with a hot flow, tested and got doe
Invested and stressed the best to finesse a opto
As I reminisce never forgot when I was very broke
Shot the Henny straight, couldn't afford to cop the cherry coke

Or should I say broke with wealth
To know enough to give them just rope to yoke they self
Playin' me before I take the ring and pawn it
The long arm of the law couldn't even put they fingers on it

Dog on it, do the statistics
How he bust lyrics was too futuristic for ballistics
And far too eccentric for forensics
I dedicate this mix to Subroc, the Hip Hop Hendrix


Shayton never came so ill, he got skill
Met a brother from the drill that gave my spine chills
All thirty three nerves controllin' my curves
Common sense just swerved every time I got served

Stress, frustration, empty rhetoric
Cold as winter in Connecticut, compassion lackin' deficit
Thought it was love life sent from above, you not a soulmate
More ways and actions of a crimate

Who by low and census comin' faker than extensions
Pistol way you're gettin' tensions outta here, sister was missin'
Intuition baby, it was me, I couldn't see
Holdin' onto fantasy, gettin' bitten by reality

War wounds, purple heart, love veteran
Morphine, pain killers, drugs and medicine
Anything just to forget the hurt
Incoming, take cover, hit the dirt

On the frontline there's causalities in the mind
And the POW's get left behind
Mentally scarred for life
Love is war when some chics are just too hard to wife

I should've indebted you from Genesis
Instead of hittin' them Guinnesses
Now I'm free fallin', cursin' at the street, brawlin'
He cease callin', no appetite for free stallin'

So deep all in, I bet he never stop ballin'
Women, forsake God for the scent of a man
Sacrifice, I hold life for a slice, overstand?
Maybe it's a lack of pigment, loneliness imagine figment
Only got the car tinted to pull extra G's in it

Damn, Jody, comin' with the okie doke, pokie poke
Steady rockin' boats, got me aimin' for your throats
Sniper scope, weren't we supposed to elope?
Propose, then you froze, I don't think that I can cope

War wounds, purple heart, love veteran
Morphine, pain killers, drugs and medicine
Anything just to forget the hurt
Incoming, take cover, hit the dirt

On the front line there's causalities in the mind
And the POW's get left behind
Mentally scarred for life
Love is war when some chics are just too hard to wife

Constant frustration, stemmin' from a no win situation
Rushin' lust and fornication adding to the complication
Patience is a virtue, pain run deep with love desert you
Listenin' to wisperin', choosin' chaos over discipline

Simpleton, life should really be a piece of intimate
Relationships swiftin' in, flower essence, Penstemon
Gentlemen, my favorite shit, so I never forsaken it
I persevere, make it fit, sculptin' and reshapin' it

Takin' sips off a fifth [Incomprehensible] passionate incense
Insets, candles lit, scandalous
Emotional bandages, why would he abandon us?
Guess he couldn't handle it, the boss is magnanimous

War wounds, purple heart, love veteran
Morphine, pain killers, drugs and medicine
Anything just to forget the hurt
Incoming, take cover, hit the dirt

On the frontline there's causalities in the mind
And the POW's get left behind
Mentally scarred for life
Love is war when some chics are just too hard to wife


It's the beat, he hear it in his sleep sometime
Blare it in your jeep so your peoples can stare at them rhymes
Real rhymes, not your everyday hologram
Even when ribs were touchin' never swallowed the ham

He'd rather eat a sand sandwich salad
It might need salt like your man's bland ballad
A lot of stuff happens that the news won't tell you's
Loose all L juice, snooze all hell loose

Rake it, take it like the good, the bad, the ugly
Break it rollin' through your hood in the caddy buggy
Butter softy, leather flossy, fatty juggy
Always threw me off when she told me, â€½Daddy, funk meâ€

I'm like anywho's
Seeds walkin' all out in street without any shoes
I guess it's better than some funky socks
You need to get her some skips before she catch the monkey pocks

Instead she wants to hear the beatbox
Take pills and make fake krills as sheetrock
Sing it, bring it back to your laboratory
While he's in his oratory, glorious like a horror story

The mask is like Jason
They told the place not to let the basket type case in
He could be some kind of wacko
Waiting for the chance to heat the pipes like a crack hoe

He busted in, blessed be the Lord
Who believe any mess then read up on the message board
If so I got bridges for the low, low
Same bitch a go dry snitchin' to the popo

Yeah, orange peal stoges for the hotel
Feel like I have been gone over a year, came home to old gear
It was the shit when I first scooped it
At least I get to sit out in New York and curse, stupid

Plead the fifth, sip wine stiffly
Patiently come up and be spiffy in a jiffy
Gift for the grind, criminal mind shifty
Swift with the nine through a fifty nine fifty

Well edjumacated, he heard it when he meditated
In deep data, had her hate the Greek plata
Dedicated cheap skater who keeps data
Sage stays self medicated and sleep later

Side effects is similar to sugar pill
Whoever go next on the mic he put a bugger ill
And made his exit on some calm shit
Begged him on the regular for kegs of more vomitspit

As the life cycle goes on ... goes on

And you learn to hold on (hold on)
To things like the mic ... the mic

And you learn to appreciate who is the nicest on said device

But who is the finest?

Time at shashuma, too much drama, blind behind the rumor
Time and time and time, my mind, I'm trying to find a tumor
Time at shashuma, no time for humor
As soon as one of ya' men's dead in Hempstead, you trying to find Pumas
Sooner the better, even knitted a sweater already
Keep your leather, we coming through the brutal weather
We ready to do whatever, yo' Doom you with it?

(You know it like a poet, my brother)
(Hey, Gunn you wit it?) Whatever... [the finest!]

I know about going paid to broke, to next day well-off
To bust a shell off, to dick-riders: "Get the hell off"
Made a call to a client, he must've had his cell off
A show-off, he has the same bite but fell off
I tell off the bat, from science to pure facts
Which niggas is wack 'til they last two tracks
Matter fact, y'all could wait for the rep to tell
The tall-tale, how he escape from out the depths of hell

When die, he gon' die like a soldier die:
Holding a swollen eye, drinking Olde Gold
Smoking a stog, watching po-po patrol the beach
Blowing my high, rolling by, when Gunn die
He gon' try to preach the streets then go to the sky

Yup! That hold water, like drizzle in a paper cup
This one etched in stone, the chisel with the paper up
I need a cut: a taper-up, edge-up
Niggas can't measure up, I'm here to get the treasure up

Stands up and hold 'em high, do or die
He got heat, no surprise, stop the beat, close your eyes
Got the weed, rolling lah
Not sweet, so no demise, all the guys drops seeds so multiply
Within the prophecies hold the lie

He bled my mother and my father, but can't bleed me
OD, ghetto misery, he bled my brother, my sister, but can't bleed me
A OG, ghetto misery, bled my mother, my father, but can't bleed ...

Me ... sci-fly, whole style stuck up
Used to talk to myself, I told him, "Shut the fuck up!"
Buckle up, cause it's about to be rough
He said, "Keep talking that shit, you 'bout to be snuffed"
Then we squashed it, I let em know: "Watch it --
We only met a time to join these rhymers in the mosh pit"
Gosh, it feels great just to increase the chance
For a pussy nigga face to hit the dance floor

I pull ya' top up, got clout, crack rock, what?
Now it's all good business, and so this bitch is locked up
On the dance floor: you got knocked out, your bitch got knocked up
Baby-face, and hey can you brand you, brand new machete
Damn, I just shook your hand and can't stand you already
Can't stand you, understand you deadly
But my hammer's like a band, my man, it's Brand New and Heavy
Yo' Doom, you ready?

(Yeah! Yo' Gunn, you with it?) Whatever..

Come on stay, I wrote this rhyme on my born-day
Remind me of the same style I flipped on "Hey!"
Yikes! Who can fuck with the likes
Of one such who scores touchdown and spikes mic's
Metal grill, with many styles, better still
Feel like number 26 on a roulette wheel
And deal, and run rings around rhymers
And run rings like number runners whose old-timers

Shorty in the all black, she think she all that
I called her, she said, "Don't call back!"
She called me, now what you call that?
Let's go back, I sold crack
Hold gats, smoke that, drink that, toke that
Fuck! Where that ho at? Where that dough at?

Suffering succotash! This hooker broke into his last buck of cash
He love her, motherfuck her ass
Metal feet dented your car fender
My agenda up in the basement party tipping the bartender
Is unbeknownst to you -- who could get body blown?
MF like Mike Fran Corleone
And got it sown, maricon, like to know what you staring at?
An invisible cat, who pull off a disappearing act
Raised by a pack a wild wolves, it's like Sweetback
Front? I'mma be back! (Like brothers in the street act)
(Surrounded by a bunch a bad bitches like Sweetback)
(Fuck with me I'll be back)

Like niggas in the streets act (streets act!)


Give it a sec for the pain to start
This wreck right here, it ain't for the faint of heart
They thought they saw the worst verse
From the team of G men who seem like nerds at first

Once they get to know us people dig us
Leaders in the fight for equal rights for niggaz
Inventor of the more demented flow, nobody doubt it
Just go for it, if you bout it bout it or rowdy, rowdy

Whatever's clever, the master fold
Who every hooka heard of but now, ho, no
If we see tomorrow, the next day classes
The villain in the back with the x-ray glasses

Have no fear, the ninja here
Feel em like the tinge in your ear from drinkin' ginger beer
When it's on loco head gon' lay low
And heat it like beef patty, coco bread kon queso

If you say so lace the whole case load
They say he wear a metal mask in case his face show
He told em they flows is bitch talk and ayo's
His whole crew walk with pitchfork and halos

Say, ho, if you never worked a J-O
And keep more cash then a stash in a peso
Okay, yo, y'all know who to follow
Tie em up in the crib and leave the place hollow

Oh, shoot the goose, she's loose
So wild you couldn't chase it down with straight fruit juice
Frown like the first time you taste cous cous
Stash the deuce deuce, troops askin' truce, truce

Today on intense wreck week
We have the super villain in his own defense to speak
It's all part of my mental techniques
Available to freaks and pencil neck geeks

Train the same brain to a insane train of thought
On a campaign trail he came to gain your support
Charge cash for a autograph
Say some shit to make your daughter laugh then slaughter the ass

Seem em on the big screen like Steve McQueen
Do something and never be back once he leaves the scene
Keep more medicated pads than Stridex
For his own side wrecks with no known side effects

Before you press charges use your noodle
So what when he grab the mic he scratch your cute cuticles
Keep your mouth shut, everything will be beautiful
It would be often rude to you, now get back to your hooty hoo

Damn it, it ain't worth the drama, can it
From the calm bandit eat rhymers like pomegranate
Soon as he stepped in he lit the room
Boom, reschedule my noon with Britt Hume

Doom in love with Mary Jane, she's my main thing
Pulled her right from that web head, what a lame brain
Maintain and say it, don't spray it
You wanna see your girl again, you might as well pay it

If I had a dime for every rhymer that bust guns
I'll have a cool mil' for my sons in trust funds
When I was broker than a broke dick dog
I always kept a L to smoke in thick fog

When it rain it sure do thunderstorm
I got more rhymes in the summer than musty underarms
One, two, microphone checker
First learned to neck off a Home Ec homewrecker

This is back when he was like crib age
When he hit the stage it's like a gauge to the rib cage
Break the mic like a rock star, break a guitar
Jump off the stage like, yee haw


Ladies

Mary, you make me wanna eat you
Every time I see you, it's like the first time I meet you
Fragrance like a flower, subtle and sweet too
Seductive and whatever, it might as well be see through

Like my genie in a bottle
Miss could get me rich like a magaziney model
Before you know it, he have her on a stroll
Fresh and ripe, perplexin' like Acapulco Gold

If I had to guess, just right, not a day old
Like a cradle robber, copped her off, shop a trailer load
Know the right number, you can get her
And hit while you would've sold to the highest bidder like

Fruits and berries, bring daddy loot in a hurry
Just be cute and don't worry
Type to make a nigga hallucinate and admit it
Then she started losing weight, lettin' everybody hit it

I like Ally, sometimes she gets bitter
Always kept me happy, never had a problem with her
She used to let me use her, back when I was looser
Respect her to this day, and never did abuse her

I told her I'll be faithful, but she don't believe me
I probably coulda been, if I never meet Eevee
She make me feel all fuzzy inside, it's loco
You won't get nowheres near her if you're broke though

Kept a shorty, can't find 'em much thinner
If caught I get mad time just for touchin' her
Knock wood, so much for hymens
So fly, she should be in the sky with diamonds

Little young thing, she likes to do the tongue thing
At times, she would play hard to get, grunting
Or something, she made me feel like the number one king
Run into her now, and we still catch a fun fling

Met her at Central Park this one time
Had the God mentally sparked, reflectin' sunshine
She said, you need to stop messin' wit that white girl
She fuckin' wit ya head and got ya heart in tight curl

We messed around once or twice, but she don't know me
She helped me get money at the Dutch price OT
Plus she from Columbia, so she really Spanish
Cookie known to make a cat bank account vanish

And Miss Hazy, all the women mature black
Every time she sees me, I end up gettin' pulled back
All she want me to do is blaze it crazy
The only one complaint is, she make me too lazy

Sugar mommy laced me with the butter Navy Avi
Just her way to makeup for the headaches that she gave me
It's all gravy, when I'm done getting my mack on
Ally is always there to help me get back on

Ladies


KEEP YA HOES IN CHECK!(.Super!)
I got this girl and she wants me to duke Her
I told her I'd come scoop her around 8, she said "Super!"

MF DOOM... hes like D.B. Cooper

and can't live with this, handle yo bidness
villain'll stay on a scandalous hoes shit list
one pack of cookies please Mr. Hooper
its fun smackin rookies, he is the "Super!"
look like a black wookie when he let his beard grow
weirdo, brown skin'ded always kept his hair low
rumor has it its a S-curl accident
DOOM was always known to keep the best girls backs bent
some say its the eyes, some say the accent
a lotta guys wonder where they stacks went
I call her thunder thighs, with the fatty swolla
only mess wit high rollas, do what daddy told her
no matter the city she with me to do the thang thang
work in the coochie, hooptie chitty chitty bang bang
same name on the titty as on the name ring
pretty like Baby D off "all in the same gang"
keep my eye on her really don't trust her
but I treat her like a daughter, taught her how to bust a nut
and the heat to turn beef to horsemeat chalupa
teach her how to hold it, of course he is the "Super!"

or beat her to a stupor, take it from the "Super!"
ya need to make her feel cuter
and lay down the G like Luther, everythin'll be "Super!"

so she look sweet when she go to meet the "Super!"
got the buddha get the Grenadiers, twist it
put it in the air, come 'ere, kiss it

when she's on the rag never let her fry the Ragu
which will have you under some type of spell crying "dag boo"
her name on ya back in her tattoo
whether a bourgie broad, nerd hoe, street chick
don't call her wifey if you met her at the freaknick
you don't want her don't waste her time, I'll dupe her

make sure for extra wreck let 'em know how you feel
and while he's runnin down to all star weekend to ball
I'm comin with the U-HAUL!(Super!)
(.Super!) (...Super!)


Tripping off the beat kinda, dripping off the meat grinder
Heat niner, pimping, stripping, soft street minor
China was a neat signer, trouble with the script digits
Double dip/bubble lips, sorrow less midget
Borderline schizoid, sort of fine tits tho
Pour the wine hold the grind, quarter to nine, lets go
Ever since ten eleven, glad she met a brethren
Then his last style seven alligator, seven at the gates of heaven
Knocking, no answer, slow dancer, hopeless romancer, dopest flow stanzas
Yes, no Villain, Metal Face the death stroke
Guest shows, still incredible in escrow
Just say hoe, I will taste the yayo, Wild West style fest, y'all best to
lay low
Hey bro, Day Glo, set the bet, pay dough
Before the cheddar get away, you best to get Maaco
The worst haters God on perpetrated are favors
Demonstrated in the perforated Rod Lavers
... In all quad flavors, large savers
Still back in the game like Jack Lalanne
think you know the name, don't rack your brain
on a fast track to half insane
Either in a slow beat or that of speed or wrath of Kane
Laughter, pain
Doom's songs lit, in the booth, with the best host
Doing bong hits, on the roof, in the west coast
He's at it again
Mad at the pen
Glad that we win a tad fat in a bad hat for men
Grind the cinnamon, Manhattan warmongers
You can find the Villain in satin congas
The vans screeches
The old man preaches
About the gold sand beaches
The cold hand reaches
For the old tan ellesse's
... Jesus


So nasty that it's probably somewhat of a travesty
Having me daily total people
You can call me Your Majesty
Keep your battery charged
You know it won't stick, yo
And it's not his fault you kick slow
Should've let your trick 'ho chick hold your sick glow
Plus nobody couldn't do nothin' once he let the brick go
And you know I know that's a bunch of snow
The beat is so butter
Peep the slow cutter
As he utters the calm flow
Don't talk about my moms, yo
Sometimes he rhyme quick, sometimes he rhyme slow
And vice versa
Whip up a slice of nice verse pie
Hit it on the first try
Villain: The Worst Guy
Spot hot tracks like spot a pair of fat asses
Shots of the scotch from out of square shot glasses
And he won't stop 'till he got the masses
An' show 'em what they know now through flows of hot molasses
Do it like a robot to headspin to boogaloo
Took a few minutes to convince the average bug-a-boo
It's ugly, like look at you! It's a damn shame
Just remember All Caps when you spell the man name
And you know it like a poet, like baby doll
I bet she tried to say she gave me her all, she played ball
All bets off! The Villain got the dice rigged
And they say he accosted the man with the sliced wig
Allegedly; the investigation is still ongoing
In this pesky inition he gots the best con flowin'
The pot doubles, now they really got troubles
Madman never go *pop*!, like snot bubbles


The rest is empty with no brain but the clever nerd
The best emcee with no chain ya ever heard
Take it from the Tec-9 holder
They've bit but don't know their neck shine from Shinola
Everything that glitters ain't fishscale
Lemme think, don't let her faint get Ishmael
A shot of Jack got her back it's not an act stack
Forgot about the cackalack, holla back, clack clack blocka
Villainy, feel him in ya heart chakra chart toppa
Start shit stoppa be a smart shoppa
Shot a cop day around the way 'bout to stay
But who'd a know there's two mo' that wonder where the shooter go
'Bout to jet, get him, not a bet, dead 'em
Let 'em spit the venom said 'em got a lot of shit with 'em
Let the rhythm hit 'em, it's stronger in the other voice
We makes the joints that make 'em spread 'em butta moist
Man, please, the stage is made of panties
From the age of baby hoochies on to the grannies
Ban me the dough rake, daddy
The flow make her fatty shake, patty cake, patty cake
For fake, if he was Anita Baker's man
He'd take her for her masters, hit it once an' shake her hand
On some ol' thank ya ma'am an' ghost her
She could mind the toaster if she sign the poster
A whole host of roller coaster riders
Not enough tracks (is it?)
Hot enuff black (for ya)
It's too hot to handle, you got blue sandals
Who shot ya? Ooh got you new spots to vandal?
Do not stand still, both show skills
Close but no krills, toast for po' nils, post no bills
Coast to coast Joe Shmoe's flows ill, go chill
Not supposed to overdose No-Doz pills
Off pride tykes talk wide through scar meat
Off sides like how Worf rides with Starfleet
Told ya, on some get-rich shit
As he get older he gets colder than a witch tit
This is it, make no mistakes
Where my nigga go?
Figaro, Figaro

O's beats and my rhymes attack
A scary act
All black like Ms. Mary Mack
Wait 'til you see 'em live on the piano
DOOM sings soprano like "una duociano" 
My momma told me
Blast him and pass her her glass of Ol' E
Not to be troublesome
But I could sure use a quick shot of double rum
No stick of bubble gum
I like ice cream
We could skip the weddin'
Have a nice dream
She only let him stick the head in


Yo, yo, yo, y'all can't stand right here
In his right hand was your man's worst nightmare
Loud enough to burst his right eardrum close-range
The game is not only dangerous, but it's most strange
I sell rhymes like dimes
The one who mostly keep cash but brag about the broker times
Joker rhymes, like the "Is you just happy to see me?" trick
Classical slap-stick rappers need Chapstick
A lot of 'em sound like they in a talent show
So I give 'em something to remember, like the Alamo
Tally-ho! A high Joker like Spades game
Came back from five year layin' and stayed the same
Sayin' - electromagnetic feeling blocks all logic, Spock
And G- shocks her biological clock
When I hit it, slit her to the shitter, thought I killed her goose
Her Power-Use was pure Brita water, filtered juice
Keep a pen like a fiend keep a pipe wit' 'im
Gentleman who lent a pen to a friend who write wit' 'im
Never seen the shit again, but he's still my dunny
Only thing that come between us is krill and money
I sell rhymes like dimes
The one who mostly keep cash but brag about the broker times
Better rhymes make for better songs, it matters not
If you got a lot of what it takes just to get along
Surrender now or suffer serious setbacks
Got get-back, connects wet-back, get stacks
Even if you gots to get jet-black, head to toe
To get the dough, battle for bottles of Mo' or 'dro
This rhyme flow take practice like Tae Bo
With Billy Blanks
Oh, you're too kind! Really, thanks.
To the gone and lost forever like "Oh My Darling Clementine"
He hold his heart when he tellin' rhymes
When it's his time, I hope his soul go to Heaven
He's nasty like the old time Old Number Seven
You still taste it when you chase it with the Coca-Cola
Make you wish they coulda erased out the Motorola
I told her - no credit for it back
If you want what they got, then go get it, it's all gak
Only in America could you find a way to make a healthy buck
And still keep your attitude on self-destruct
I sell rhymes like dimes
The one who mostly keep cash, but tell about the broke times
Joker rhymes, like the "Is you just happy to see me?" trick
Classical slap-stick rappers need Chapstick
A lot of them sound like they in a talent show
So I give 'em something to remember like the Alamo
Tally-ho! High Joker like Spades game
Came back from five years layin' - stayed the same
Sayin' - electromagnetic field will block all logic, Spock
And G-shock her biological clock
When I hit her, slit her to the shitter, thought I killed her goose
Her Power-Use was pure Brita water, filtered juice
Keep a pen like a fiend keep a pipe wit' 'im
Gentleman who lent a pen to a friend who write wit' 'im
Never seen the shit again, but he still my dunny
Only thing that come between us, is krill and money
We sell rhymes like dimes
The one who mostly keep cash but tell about the broke times

Then your heart's a noise
She reflects
That she loooves you, sweetie 
She wants you paid

Check it out, ch'all! Ya don't stop! Keep on, to the sure shot!
Huh-ha!
Uh, uh, uh, uh, oh!
Yeah, you're listening to the buttery slickness
The Land-O-Lakes from my man MF Doom!
Ha ha ha ha! Yeah!
Rock-shockin' the house, with another nugget
Uh-uh-ah, eh, oh, ah, hoo-wee!
Yeah!
Regulation status, right here, Fondle 'Em Recordings
1999
Yeah!
Now what are you 'posed to say on the end of records?
I don't know! Yeah!
Whoo! Yeah!
Mashed potatoes
Applesauce
Buttery... biscuits
And I get lost
A yes, yes, yes y'all
You don't stop
Keep on... a' to the breakadawn
Say what?
Uh!
Yeah!
You thought it all was over!
You thought the song was over!
Ah! We tricked you, we tricked you
Ha ha ha ha... Whoo!
You're listening to www.hairline.com
MF Doom, Cool Bob Love...


By the way,

get smoked like winston
ciggarettes
ho's get ripped off like nicorette
(patch)
in real life
the real trife scene
might snatch ya life like a-ssault machine
rifle
dead up setup like bull-fight
be blunted how we like
couldnt white or in full flight
the unemotional
call me anti-social
on the run off the gun
death tally commercial
death valley?
is like rehearsal to the streets

dont make me have to hurt them feelins
ill ruin you in the dirt that i be doin in my dealins
sendin spirits through the ceilin'-
chrome peelin'-
dome blown
within the comforts of your own home
grown big
wheelin' and high rollin'
I hold the lye-

how X the unseen feels
when givin crews a brush with death like between meals
two times a day
wit brothers thats tight like a noose
wit more rhymes in use than doctor seuss
or motherfuckin' mother goose
X is da suspicious flirter
who every hooker hearda'

more hits than a ounce no doubt
about ta bounce,
X the unannounced-
im out...

and i like to give a shoutout,
to the brother jet-jaguar...
Megalon...
and King Ghidra...

I call this joint right here...
Gas Drawls...
In hell wit yours...


I only play the games that I win at
And stay the same with more rhymes than there's ways to skin cats
As a matter of fact, let me rephrase
With more rhymes and more ways to fillet felines these days
Watch the path of the black one
Supervillian he wrecks clubs for dell
In a drunken stupor chillin
Ready and willin to inadvertantly foil that plan of any rhymer, whiner or
spoiled brat
Who got more snottier flows than snotty nose?
And holds mics like he knows karate body blows
Nobody knows the trouble I see
from the MPB fly dirty tailin the eye bubble eye thirty
For the record this is some shit I just thought of y'all
Science fiction that's not admissable in no court of law
I live to rock mics 3-D
The only reason I seek to stop to snuff the TV
I heard beats, they sound like karaoke
With monkey rhymers on a leash like don't have this fairy choke me
Hit 'em with a penny so we can get these peanuts
And I thought we was nuts, I used to get free cuts
They locks Lex Luthor up in green haven
Since when a nigga never really been to clean shaven
Misbehavin rap stars need mistament
Call me Mista Bent
I'm at where your sister went
Intelligent, used to write and be well spoke
Now all a nigga wanna do is fight and sell, tell a joke
This could lead to catastrophe
Bout to stop the violence right after these last three shots from the black
bat got me at headlock
Holdin on to sanity while stranded at dreadlock
She told me get off I said
Bitch, let me set this shit off so I could get rich right quick
Then it hit me like the point of intoxication
Nigga come out and rock this nation like oxifacen
A lot of niggas out is rusty like oxidation
In the world's most strangest most dangerous occupation
But you could do it, you the Super like in your building
Villian like trife kingdom wear and all my children
Plottin and it sure to pay ends
With some more mature womens and more of they friends
And when bad men roll tight, it's actual true
Like a pack of big bamboo with natural glue
Who grip necks of becks next to triple X
He just came before D followed the ripple effects
And it'll lead you right to him
Oh snap, it seems you walked into a trap do wrap
Zoinks, this place is filled with pretender willies
One false move and get broke off like end of phillies
True believers ain't nothin new to a
Crook with special powers like how to tell the future uh uh
Rhyme of the month two page long
Bustin off two gages with my cake gone wrong
Son it's on remind me of a Raekwon tape song
With a fleet of super bad status Rae Dawn Chong
Let me know if y'alls with me y'all
Nasty yo and geographic down to the titty bar
Rap monster outer city y'all
To all my brothers who is doin' unsettling bids
You could have got away with it if it was not for them meddling kids


A fly tramp, that's what she called me
'Cause I don't wear no Stetson hats like Paul C
As y'all see, who give a fuck? Who know what is it?
These styles will be flipped to the absolute exquisite
It's like a blizzard, soon as I got home from ATL
Looked into my baby's face, my boo was like ... "Well!
I know your types of clientele! Thoughts, needs"
As I held her firmly, yet gentle as the soft sea
She said, "The one with the horse weave?" The pretty one?"

All crazy, had to touch the tattoo through the short sleeve
Which one you want? I'm like, "If there was comp?
Fuck around, a nigga like me probably run up in all three!"
King Geedorah what they call me, either caesar or baldy
Probably half-boozed since last y'all saw me
On the D-low, I slaughter solo emcees, they paper-thin
In they Polo, Nautica, or DK men

Amen! It's funny how significance make a difference
Notice parables of three in every other inference
For instance: "Who wanna battle? On the real?
Choose your weapon: microphone, beats, or the wheels-of-steel"
I own a crown in all three for getting down without a doubt
I'd like to give a extra special out

To Jet Jaguar, the sun, moon and star

The Monster Island Czars – y'all know who you are

Get that!

Coming straight from the black lungs
I rip tracks for all players that pack guns
Stack ones in packs, done and doing back-to-back runs
To my peeps that close, so's ya' knows what's up
Y'all know the dough's quick, hoes that mess with 5-O shrimp like, "What?"
Like they wanna shmoosh us, just to packing the pushers
I'm packing gat then bust a cap at po-po
If they catch us and try to push us
Since when a MINY nigga don't be taking no shit?
I be that drug dealing nigga that be fucking ya' bitch!

What a fella! Like Salt, Pepa, Spinderella
I came to spark the deaf, dumb and blind like Helen Keller
If I'm not with George of the Jungle, if he not with Stella
Or either Priscilla, I'm doing dips on Godzilla
Though y'all know he don't play, right?
TNT throws a nigga out a moving van in broad daylight
And he was shackled by hands and feet
Then they say he tried to escape, once his face scraped the concrete
Near the curb on Monster Island, 103 Street
Where brothers run the risk of getting swallowed once the Beast eat
I'd rather lay in the cut, collect cash pay
Only TNT I see is Gilligan's castaway
With Mary Jane and Ginger
Oh, from which you spent the night by accident, I creep like a ninja
When the mack is bent, who can give one fuck?
Get bucked, get broke up like three-piece nun-chucks
Y'all sun struck, sick to they head-piece
Three-headed beast brings the drama to a dead cease

(Get that money, god)

Sick to they head-piece
(Get that money, god)

(Get that money, god)

(Get that money, god)

Greenbacks ... the meanest green stacks


"Yeah, here we go... just go with the flow" (repeats 4 times)

Yo, I'd like to check this microphone before I start right quick
Microphone check 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2

Big up all the Monsta Island massive
And beware before I triple dare you like the last kid
Who ask me what we don't got that you got son
For one, flow that's elementary my dear Wat-son
Secondly, ever since I was little
Not so much to riddle, least rhyme to the syllable
Keep tracks that make a Arab thief clap
With no hands, I chop these drums off
Truly yours, G Rap
Actual fact, relax
In this land of lyrical loss, black
I'm not the cool sleet stack
The one who might stop and talk to you
Poison to few, niggas who be bitin styles I'm like pork to
Oooh... what you got to lose? Let mud fly
When I got blues I chew whole crews that's bud dry
So I ask why the style's from the cess
Shit be fuckin with my eye as I pull it to the chest
The super muthafuckin' villain grip the mic wit an iron hand
Throwin emcees to the fire from out da fryin' pan
It ain't no use in tryin, man
Son, stop cryin
Frontin' like you death-defyin'
You need to stop lyin'
Speak your piece only once you're spoken to first
Now lemme hear your verse while I'm chokin' you
With bubbly fine rhymes like a editor
Throw them to my collection of skulls and spines like Predator
Fuck around, the only niggas who could hear the same sound (who?)
Was Jet Jaguar and James Brown
(Yeah, yeah only them two niggas?)
And I'm glad I took the time to write their names down to big 'em up
(True, true)

I'd like to say hi
It's {?} fly the odd Merlin
That's quick to whip up a script like Rod Sterling
{?} bad bitch who used to whip the Sterling
Who see God?, never see God earlin'
My man Grimm had his little monkey like Space Ghost
Me myself I got flavors that out-taste most
With numb gums, some rhymers is lake toast
Back to you MF Doom, you late show host
S to the U to the P E R-uh
Who chronicle these times in a 3-D horror
{?} co-star or in a realer drama
Who break bread with stingy kin-men, indian borrower
Lone gunmen who candidly flip fly floes
Single-handedly with one eye closed
In a fly pose, no shirt {?}
May see me stack the quarter-mill cash pay
That's in a smash way how he did it
Muthafucka probably couldn't peep it past a minute


To my Metal Face bros with stomachs of cast iron
Who been in to win and blast to the last siren
On the slow-mo the calm artist with the so-so chick
Chased them all like how he did to Slobodan Milosevic
Anyhoo, how 'bout them Yankees?
Once I leave off-stage the party people thanks mee's
If I may speak freely nasty like the freaky-deeky
At your local sleazy speakeasy
For any fan of the limelight
In the mic stand was left a lit stick of dynamite
It's risky business like hand-to-hand crack sale
With rappers who's better off on the cover of Black Tail
Jumpin Jehoshaphat, who's that?
Who cats who do magic like "Tell me how you do's that"
Heck no, especially those who cop pleas like gecko
Thought I might do techno
Ha ha, betcha bust out laughing at the vet
For no reason he get cussed out like Tourette's
Yet tight flow to make her bad ass stutter
Or even crack a smile from a mad fast cutter
But uh... word play since third grade age
Back when we used to play "Bang! Open bird cage"
Hip hop Benny Hill, Sip Henny straight
Get every penny, wait, then he chill, at any rate
My metal face hoes with tongue or 'least eye ring
Do yourself, I will continue to do my thing
Like Kung-Fu fighting everybody was biting
Then the super-villain struck again like lightning
In the same spot (bzzz!) now what's the chance of that?
And a name drop like pick the name out the hat
That's a known drop from the, liver conniver
Who vote player out the rap game like Survive while I
Drop degrees like a nerd cat wheeling ten speed
So way back spin your back and then freeze
While I play high-ball, low-ball, to zero
So called rhymers, go call Cleo
While I, steal the show like "thought so, try hikin"
Super-duper stars need Ortho Tri-Cyclen
Sometimes the men, mostly from the women
I hear voices saying that's the super-villain
(Uhh, I hear voices)
Mostly from the women, I hear voices... super-villain

Fiends who rub nose, Gs and cut-troaths,
Paso deal the brownstone,
Quick as Ronald with the quarter pounder,
with the chrome nickels kid'll pound ya frown inside out,
leak ya brain splattered on the side walk, matter out ya eyeballs,
Drive by on chrome wheels and get ya screen touched, iphone
Weed flushed in my home, by friends that my man known,
Ds roll by, see the crusts in the bathroom,
Homie told me I'll be back soon, no fooling me,
I now he folded just so the pigs'll have nothin to do but,
ask me, fronting like i'm handfull,
saw the man toss dope,
and I'm the one who be,
can tossed yo?
gat go boom boom boom,
red fog and six holes in ya dome,
rip lobes and til ya head opened,
with all kinds of lead flowin,
choked by gun smoke when cars be holding enemies,
God hold the block, gots to ask the god who hold the glock,
Yo God, can I breathe,
Can I breed, Is it Over?
Can I see, Ask him for pass in,
Scars and memories,
each day we bleed til we be passing
indefinitely, concieved in the LKC,
die in Infinities, white T reeking of Hennessy,
brought back memories, father locked north up
and my moms snort crack remedies,
lack remedies be just what I did,
no school, no cool
No fool, but fuck politics,
Dead prez educated hit shit of which I lit dollars with,
Hard Boiled, Chow Yum,
Boiled hard since six,
Rather on a brick during class, my ass'd never sit
and give a, fuck bout Hitler,
Caesar, Ask the teacher,
why am I need of, knowing this?
Can't you see I'm on the corner, bitch?
but fuck that now, man I'm grown and shit,
This shit, I'm locked forever in.
route blocked by hoes, past they prime elegance,
Hobo's with kids clothes, to trade em for some medicine,
walk the streets in the defeat,
kicking cans of fifth,
and all that I can think is,
Can I live?


Yeah
Another love song gone wrong
So know you are a WOOP
Like based God in wonton
But I didn't
And I ain't even tripping
Another foul ball
But I'm still glad I hit it
'Cause a lot of niggas didn't, you know
Coulda shoulda type like,
"Oh, it was like, too tight"
Come on, I would've pipe
But our schedules contradicted
Well I was tied down hey pipe down
First night ya boy laid the pipe down
Took off the night gown
And whipped out the slanky
Then she screamed, "Joey spank me"
And after that she even thanked me, swanky
One time for my nigga Dymes
Lord knows we'll be kicking rhymes
'Til the end of time
But back to the topic
Oh yeah I'm pissed off
I'm still tripped off
And wondering why shorty dipped off
I ain't gonna front a nigga
Do miss the lip gloss
Now she sucked some next nigga dick off
And my dick soft
So tell me what the fuck I'm posed to do
And you know it ain't too easy getting over you
I sent the postcards so you know it's true
I promise that I wouldn't get emotional
And I'm not, so stop it
Why you frontin like you don't miss my whole cock
Pit down your esophagus
Screaming, "daddy stop it"
Ripping out your tracks
Chipped nail polish in the scratches of my back like
Did you forget about the time we had the sticky roll
And I tried to suck your titties whole
For milk for my cheerios
Did you forget about the video when you first came
I hit that spot twice and since then
You haven't been the same
Now I heard you fucking with some new man
Can't remember his name
But my first impression: what a lame
Lorraine said she seen him at a bowling lane
Walking out the bathroom kinda strange with a shoulder stain
Faggot
Six months, and I'm still at it
You probably never hear this track
But I still rap it
I guess I'm still attracted to you being here
I swear I can't imagine you to not even care
Whole thing played out like magic and it's kinda weird
It's like I did a trick and you won't be reappear
It ain't fair, I need you back sometimes I get scared
But I'm a player, ain't gonna let you see my tears
'Cause I'm a player, ain't gonna let you see my tears
'Cause I'm a player, ain't gonna let you see my tears
'Cause I'm a player, ain't gonna let you see my tears
'Cause I'm a player
I couldn't see it coming down my eyes
So I had to make the song cry cry
I couldn't see it coming down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I couldn't see it coming down my eyes
So I had to make the song cry cry
I couldn't see it coming down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
Yeah


I just lie awake and think of pleasant nights we'd spend
under summers magic spell
but when autumn came her love did not remain
and made my world a living hell
I just lie awake and think of pleasant nights we'd spend

I used to cop a lot
But never copped no drop
Hold mics like pony tails, tight, and bob a lot
Stop and stick around
Come through and dig the sound
Of the fly brown six-o sicko psycho who throws his dick around
Bound to go three-plat
Came to destroy rap
It's a intricate plot of a b-boy strapped
Femstat cats get kidnapped
Then release a statement to the press - let the rest know who did that
Metal Fist terrorists claim responsibility
Broken household name usually said in hostility
Um what is MF? You silly
I'd like to take "Mens to the End" for two milli'
"Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!" That's a audio daily double
Rappers need to fall off just to save me the trouble, yo
Watch your own back
Came in and go out alone, black
Stay in the zone turn H2O to Cognac
On Doomsday!
Ever since the womb 'til I'm back where my brother went
That's what my tomb will say
Right above my government, Dumille
Either unmarked or engraved, hey, who's to say?
I wrote this one in B.C. D.C. O-section
If you don't believe me, go get bagged and check then
Cell number 17, up under the top bunk
I say this not to be mean, wish bad luck or pop junk
Pop the trunk on See-Cipher-Punk, leave him left scraped
God forbid, if there ain't no escape, blame MF tape
Definition "super-villain": a killer who love children
One who is well-skilled in destruction, as well as building
While Sidney Sheldon teaches the trife to be trifer
I'm trading science fiction with my man the live lifer
A pied piper holler a rhyme, a dollar and a dime
Do his thing, ring around the white collar crime
Get out my face, askin' 'bout my case, need toothpaste
Fresher mint, monkey-style nigga get dentadent
And dope fiends still in they teens, shook niggas turn witness
Real mens mind their own business
That's the difference between sissy-pissy rappers that's double-dutch
How come I hold the microphone double-clutch
C.O.'s make rounds, never have 'ox found
On shakedown, lock-down, wet dreams of Fox' Brown
On Doomsday!
Ever since the womb 'til I'm back where my brother went
That's what my tomb will say
Right above my government, Dumile
Either unmarked or engraved, hey, who's to say?
Doomsday
Every since the womb 'til I'm back to the essence
Read it off the tomb
Either engraved or unmarked grave, who's to say?
Pass the mic like "Pass the peas like they used to say"
Some M-er F-ers don't like how Sally walk
I'll tell y'all fools it's hella cool how ladies from Cali talk
Never let her interfere with the Yeti ghetto slang
Nicknames off nipple and tip of nipples metal fang
Known amongst hoes for the bang-bang
Known amongst foes for flow with no talking orangutangs
Only gin and Tang
Guzzled out a rusty tin can
Me and this mic is like yin and yang
Clang! Crime don't pay, listen, youth
It's like me holding up the line at the kissing booth
I took her back to the truck, she was uncouth
Spittin' all out the sunroof, through her missing tooth
But then she has a sexy voice, sound like Jazzy Joyce
So I turned it up faster than a speeding knife
Strong enough to please a wife
Able to drop today's math in the 48 keys of life
Cut the crap far as rap
Touch the mic, get the same thing a Arab will do to you for stealing
What the devil? He's on another level
It's a word! No, a name! MF the super villain!

My thoughts, are like a bright symphony
I'm simply, changing everything that I begin to see
Mentally, but physically I plan to change history
With a pen, note pad and a distant dream
But distance ain't a obstacle, that's too much
I'm closer than you think to the stars, nigga look up
Seeing adolescent with impressive rhymes, chasin' dimes
Not the kind that want cash, but the ones that's inside
Of my pocket, while I pocket some of these profits
Nigga's watch it and try to stop it, but all I do is block it
Straight lock it up, my cash started risin' up
Now everybody and they best friend try to ride with us
Never had a team, just a couple friends
Too many people around will hurt you in the end
Don't pretend you niggas would never kin, you tryna step in the circle but ain't allowed to get in
I'm getting more attention than I'm wishing
A bitch ain't just a prize and did I mention, when I'm sentencing, people listening
Cause my songs go harder than crack interventions
Uh, living life like a menace
Tryna get in this game and leave with some riches
No need for bitches, but I'm down for pictures
As long as they ain't girls that got no figures
Uh, Jordan 7's on my feet
Don't ask to come chill, girl I'm busy making beats
When I was in the hall you would never even speak
Now your tryna come through every day of the week
Shits crazy, you living real shady
And don't send me text messages calling me baby
I thought you were a lady, didn't give it up daily
And only your joy, boys who didn't like mainstream
Well I do, and this is nothing new
But looks like this life fine living for you
I know that you in love, but baby that sounds through
When the size don't fit, so why would I wear the shoe?
This ain't a love song so I'mma skip bars, rip hard, grip stars then dip off
Peace!


My thoughts, are like a bright symphony
I'm simply, changing everything that I begin to see
Mentally, but physically I plan to change history
With a pen, note pad and a distant dream
But distance ain't a obstacle, that's too much
I'm closer than you think to the stars, nigga look up
Seeing adolescent with impressive rhymes, chasin' dimes
Not to con that boy cash, but the ones that's inside
Of my pocket, while I pocket some of these profits
Nigga's watch it and try to stop it, but all I do is block it
Straight lock it up, my cash started risin' up
Now everybody and they best friend try to ride with us
Never had a team, just a couple friends
Too many people around will hurt you in the end
Don't pretend you niggas would never kin, you tryna step in the circle but ain't allowed to get in
I'm getting more attention than I'm wishing
A bitch ain't just a prize and did I mention, when I'm sentencing, people listening
Cause my songs go harder than crack interventions
Uh, living life like a menace
Tryna get in this game and leave with some riches
No need for bitches, but I'm down for pictures
As long as they ain't girls that got no figures
Uh, Jordan 7's on my feet
Don't ask to come chill, girl I'm busy making beats
When I was in the hall you would never even speak
Now your tryna come through every day of the week
Shits crazy, you living real shady
And don't send me text messages calling me baby
I thought you were a lady, didn't give it up daily
And only your joy, boys who didn't like mainstream
Well I do, and this is nothing new
But looks like this life fine living for you
I know that you in love, but baby that sounds through
When the size don't fit, so why would I wear the shoe?
This ain't a love song so I'mma skip bars, rip hard, grip stars then dip off
Peace!


I remember when, last past November when
Clown kid got pounded in with the Timberlands
They left him trembling, he was not remembering:
Never tuck your denim in just to floss an emblem
Some would debate you, "Wait, the fella ate gelatin
Or he been listening in to what his weathermens was telling him"
When I could feel it in my melanin, it's compelling
Us to break them off, no reassembling
No science-fiction to no theater near you, coming soon to
Fuck with you frequently like how phases of the moon would do
You could gather 'round like it was an eclipse
Just don't look directly to the bitch, you may be blinded by the glimpse

Pass the L, the last to tussle in them shirttails
All hail, King Geedorah, the third rail
700 volts holds rap to a standstill
Fool ignore the rule, fuck up and get his man killed
Two bottles of Dom got his hands filled
And so goes the days of our lives as the hourglass sand spill
And built with Passion and a glass of the 'Ze

And I knew it was the last day ... Wig-Twisting Season
When some could get their wigs twisted back within reason
Mostly with these crimes of treason
And you'll be lucky if there's no squeezing even this evening
From how he's feeling, thrilling choice of flow is sick
He's the villain with the million dollar voice-throw trick
He's like a ventriloquist, with his fist in the speaker's back
Couldn't think of no uniquer track, nope, sneak attack
It don't really matter how big them is. So much as a nipple
Cause you could have a chick with D-Triple
'Cept the nipple little. Just hot off the griddle
Like how he do monkey rhymers, like Monkey-in-the-Middle by his damn self
Ain't no average MC ahead of me
Getting cheddar instead of the probably better pedigree
With nicknames, sick games as Rick James
Messy games, sci-fly such as Jesse James

Blast, I figure, ass-hawking ass titty licker
Last one to walk up in, fast-talking city slicker
Got bagged cause of the dirty chick with make-up
Bail out quick for the 7: 30 wake-up
My only backup was an A-cup, as far as May
To when the leaves turn red and gold to Nimrod earthday
All else? Worthless to say
(And the lights went down and hey!)

That's when I knew it was the first day ... Wig-Twisting Season
When some could get their wigs twisted back within reasoning
Mostly with these crimes of treason men
And y'all be lucky if there's no squeezing even this evening

It's like a mosquito, the much sweeter resent the act
I been bent back since my Physical went back
Since, Cultured more of my kin
And for them I keep an L rolled in this hellhole
Hold your head, use your head and hold, or be dead and cold
In the worsest way, soon as the leaves show red and gold
To 'round Nimrod release day
And all else? Needless to say

Wait a motherfucking minute!! true facts presented
The names was probably changed just to protect who ain't in it
The XP was three-quarters tinted, 4/5ths was converted
The way his shit was twisted? Ask him if it hurted

... Wig-Twisting Season
When some could get their wigs twisted back within reasoning
Mostly with these crimes of lying, and fronting, and cheating
All types of different styles of treason

Ladies

Mary, you make me wanna eat you
Every time I see you, it's like the first time I meet you
Fragrance like a flower, subtle and sweet too
Seductive and whatever, it might as well be see through

Like my genie in a bottle
Miss could get me rich like a magaziney model
Before you know it, he have her on a stroll
Fresh and ripe, perplexin' like Acapulco Gold

If I had to guess, just right, not a day old
Like a cradle robber, copped her off, shop a trailer load
Know the right number, you can get her
And hit while you would've sold to the highest bidder like

Fruits and berries, bring daddy loot in a hurry
Just be cute and don't worry
Type to make a nigga hallucinate and admit it
Then she started losing weight, lettin' everybody hit it

I like Ally, sometimes she gets bitter
Always kept me happy, never had a problem with her
She used to let me use her, back when I was looser
Respect her to this day, and never did abuse her

I told her I'll be faithful, but she don't believe me
I probably coulda been, if I never meet Eevee
She make me feel all fuzzy inside, it's loco
You won't get nowheres near her if you're broke though

Kept a shorty, can't find 'em much thinner
If caught I get mad time just for touchin' her
Knock wood, so much for hymens
So fly, she should be in the sky with diamonds

Little young thing, she likes to do the tongue thing
At times, she would play hard to get, grunting
Or something, she made me feel like the number one king
Run into her now, and we still catch a fun fling

Met her at Central Park this one time
Had the God mentally sparked, reflectin' sunshine
She said, you need to stop messin' wit that white girl
She fuckin' wit ya head and got ya heart in tight curl

We messed around once or twice, but she don't know me
She helped me get money at the Dutch price OT
Plus she from Columbia, so she really Spanish
Cookie known to make a cat bank account vanish

And Miss Hazy, all the women mature black
Every time she sees me, I end up gettin' pulled back
All she want me to do is blaze it crazy
The only one complaint is, she make me too lazy

Sugar mommy laced me with the butter Navy Avi
Just her way to makeup for the headaches that she gave me
It's all gravy, when I'm done getting my mack on
Ally is always there to help me get back on

Ladies


He cleans his metal mask with gasoline
Then after I'm last seen
Pullin' a chick like a fiend
Pull a fast one
Can't put shit past him
Got niggas on his own team mad enough to blast him
Retarded in real life, on the mic Rain Man
Stand close to his main man like a chain gang
Who give a fuck about who or they fancy crew
That's no mystery that Hardy Boys do with Nancy Drew
Sorta with her drawers down quarter
The extorter bring slaughter like "Well I oughta"
I suggest you hand over the formula dulia?
A villain in your land, in his land a ruler
Hard hitting like puffin a woola with Lieutenant Uhura
Everyday feel like its an off day with Ferris Bueller
Brother pull heat to prove they're not sweet
No matter how you spell it, we still got beats

[Kurious]

We question how we live
Question, what we give
Take it to the next leave 'em where they can't see me
Still they judge but they be butt ass
Switch that wig like a muppet
Keep it simple, can't truss it
Light's the fuel
Mic is the tool
Drink Jack, kick back, drop jewel
Finish what I start
Mastered the art
Livin' hell can't explain the inhale confuse it more
Cop the .44
Contemplate meditate
Dictate
I direct my direct fate
Coming of late
Kurious
Can I say shit
Do it for CottleRock, do it for K.Nit (R.I.P)
K-N-I-T, Sub R-O-C (Eternally for M.I.C)
Only we save we

By candlelight my hand will write these rhymes 'til I'm burnt out
Mostly from experience, shit that I learned about
Topics and views, generally concerned about
With different ways to coincide earned clout
I take a look at my life I taste the trails
From Tablik and savage females
With fake nails to face scales
You out your frame for still baggin' 'em too
You know I know
These hos be asking me if I'm you
Like my twin brother we did everything together
From under ? to coppin butter leathers
Remember when you went and got the dark blue Ballys
I had all the different color Cazale Cazales
But SubRoc, you shoulda went with the Ruby and the old Ock
Truly the illest dynamic duo on the whole block
I keep a flick of you with the machete sword in your hand
Everything is going according to plan man


Feeel the magnetism between uuuus (The mic)
Growin in stronger and stronger (The mic)
Whyy dont we do it (The mic)

I was in a case out of state
She was thirteen and good we had a hotter date
It was just a number she never told she was knocked up
By the end of the summer chick almost had me locked up
My aunt came and got and steadied the block
We bounce to the yeti and I'm ready to rock
With no attachments feelin a little loose
Blowin up in every spot we had a little juice
Probably the dime on the Afghani bud in me
We played the stage standin by the speaker and suddenly
Who tapped me I'm bout to get real ill
Already ripped the whole club with metal face's steel wheel (The mic)
What a sweet surprise her with the fly eyes
And fine she pulled me to the sidelines
The mystery shot up with strong words
She was an intelligent wisdom and a song bird
I met her last week at the same place
She stepped to me the same way at a no shame pace
I'm off guard her game had me choked up
Checkin me play testin me (The mic) till I spoked up
Seven whole days and nights and not a word from you (Not a word)
I was worried I thought I woulda heard from
Stranger you know I never get enough of you
How you be comin through (The mic)
Myself and two a alikes had ran through this crew of three
In my earlier days they showed me things new to me
So we knew mad brothers who they had hit off
They even used to watch each other just to rock they shit off
When slovenly two smile and I'm scopin her
Switchin off three times a night made them more opener
So you could love Allah or leave him the hell alone
Message from my god father aside a gold telephone
Many of my men went up in smoke
While trickin with these chickens I ended up broke
You find out who's ya mans when you broke
Like a bad joke it's funny when you on you got mad folk
I played the middle man in every little scam
Some as complex as a hip hop album riddle jam
I find it's quite intriguing as I think about rappers
Walk upon me speaking with stinkin mouth (About what?)
About this and that from sneakers to hats to gats
Freak chicks with the cooty cat raps
And it's that including dice n' that
I'm at a black tie affair with a diva with the fatty fat
I play the back steady on the humble
But be right up front when we get ready to rumble
I gave her breath control ask her who she learned off
Coulda took her back to the crib somehow was turned off
Me and you was overdue
From gettin together baby
I always knew our love was meant to beee (The Mic)

Feel the magnetism (The Mic) between uuus (The Mic)
Growing stronger and stronger (The Mic)
Whyyy dont we do it

(The mic)
(...The mic)
(The-the)
(The mic)
(The mic)
(The mic)


Who you think I am, but who you want me to be?

...When I rock, jock niggaz in shellshock
Don't watch the birdie watch the clock go tick tock
I rip shop, I make ya girls bottom lip drop
Yo word to the truckers at the pit stop I'm hip hop
I hold heat, never forget what niggaz told me they showed me
Other emcees trying to fold me they owe me
Yo plus them niggaz mad slow gee
I got my "Get U Now" so I'm comin with my homie
Here's the plan: stick 'em up, I enter, through the window
Stoop down so we can't see our crescendo
Pass the indo, yo we used to be our friend though
Yeah but thats the reason I dont really like to lend dough

From the corners cylindrical triangle hats
As dutch lyrics precise life wring dem from science
Leave you entangled for months
Tryin to figure who done it, you fronted
Got cha shit stunted, didn't have to be that way
Some saw the light comin in, they shunned it
For the wickedness to those whose despise life and worship death
The established matched at eye for eye, tooth for tooth, breath to breath
These are the last days of the countdown, shit is just that drastic
Write journals, like they use the prophets, study math like a Aztec

Loved not for who you think I am, but who you want me to be
A true thuggin emcee, true thugs, with no strings attached
I wanna give you my slugs and don't wanna take em
Box sprays, but with my box cutter in my boxes
Shots sprayed, who on cops high says we? rosses?
Rock away boulevard, got love and? knoxus?
Bout five cops today, my rock away
Niggaz and rock rage, got paid
A rock, you know why I rock, meet me at the? lobses?
I suggest I should dress proper
Copped a buzz, I copped a dutch
I got a lotta love, with no strings attached

Rhymes, rhymes, rhymes, we got plenty
Times, times, times, too many
Sparked up and chat, you keep countin
I do my thing, jealous niggaz keep doubtin
Rock 'n' roll, lock 'n' load
Emcees out for pots of gold, we stop 'em cold
In they tracks an take all they? jipsuses?
All they dats, all they bullshit mixeses
Give 'em a credit, not debt it
We just flipped the calistetic
Toss the andy pettitte, you said it
We grandslam in the never boss stand
Any pussy emcee's we abandon

Flew in from Monster Island just to rag shit wit jet lag
With brothers specializin ways how us not to get bagged
Egads! I bring confusion like roll call
To emcees so-called, hoes be like "yup I told y'all"
So socialize my bio so I dip dip dive
Memorize like I-omega zip drive
Go to the bar to drink to get soberer
King Ghidra eat the head of a king cobra like king koba

Kong get a cut like Kobe, now hold heat
So sweet, roll deep but no beef
Those that doze deep, close sheets
Po chose to speak with, reach over to reload the piece
Slip from freak to deak, keep concrete
Parallel to body til the next male
Shotties and hotty, still waitin to exhale
Smell the blood bath a slugs caught
Slugs passed and bloodsport
Bugged laugh, a bugged thought
Caught some eyes make the case last stack a locker
Bocker, drink a vodka, hit note, like Sinatra at a opera
Drop a flocker, Orville Redenbocher
Get you, got you, shot the two L's without the proper
For the? abus? knocker
Hit the liquor, quicker than a quicker picker upper
Girl and stick er, I leave more nuts than a snicker
Kick er to the curb, punk a bitch, stomp a chick
For now call me Kong, Monster Isle, Monster Click (Bow!)

Loved not for who you think I am, but who you want me to be
True thuggin emcee, true thugs, with no strings attached
I wanna give you my slugs, and don't wanna take 'em back

Smack it up, flip it, pulled out, 'bout to fell
Sunday in the A-T-L and I'm all outta ale
Like a bat out of hell,
tripped on a cat tail
Mutt drinkin out a pail, who let the rat out the cell?
Got all the ingredients and recipe, might as well
Since last week the bootlegger been in jail
If all else fail, inhale the L
Makin sure they can't see your sale via
snail mail
Mind like a sewer
servin rhyme on a skewer
DOOM'll step to a fine dime like he knew her
"My black sister"
She said "Step back" before he kissed her
She did the dipper and the smack just missed her
There go a list of politics like Henry Kissinger
99% of rap is just a friendly listener
I'm like these dudes must have some screws loose to hate y'all
Or a couple of ounces short of deuce-deuce or 8 Ball
Y'all know it's time for the end, when the day come
Buy an album, get rudely insulted over fake drums
Same CD's you get for free, you break 'em
Wa-alaikum
make 'em eat they food like steak'um
Why she wanna ask me if I could pass the paprika?
One hand on the mic, the other on the
beaker
Every week or so peeked out the lab though
eureka
A technique to keep somethin uniquer in your speaker
For yo' information, I didn't do the beat y'all
It ain't my fault, if she didn't move her feet at all
Skeeter, robbed Peter to pay Paul
trick
it on Mary so she can
play ball
... Better have my
scrilla
And cut it out with all that funny hand jive will ya?
All this trouble for a tall glass of Olde E
Drink it all fast, make you haul ass slowly
Remind me to remember what you told me
Holey moley, did you get a load of her Roley Poley?
Yo G, remind me to remember what you told me
Whoever don't feel him, Feel balls like a goalie
One for the money, two for the
better green
Methylenedioxymethamphetamine
Told the knock kneed ghetto queen
Medallin and use oxcyocetaline
Who needs airplay, it's all just hearsay
Leave a wig like it was having a bad hair day
Miracle glide master, asked him what's his secret
He said 'Shasta', and turned to formaldehyde faster
When I'm home with my lady, I try to duke her daily
One night she tried to flail me with her ukulele
Pack your heat
the Villain on the cover of Black Beat
With a bunch of crackers and some snack meat
They better have my scrilla
Cut it out with all that funny hand jive will ya?
All this trouble for a tall glass of Olde E
Drink it all fast, make you haul ass slowly
Remind me to remember what you told me
Holey moley, did you get a load of her roley poley?
Yo G, remind me to remember what you told me


KEEP YA HOES IN CHECK!(.Super!)
I got this girl and she wants me to duke Her
I told her I'd come scoop her around 8, she said "Super!"
that sounds great, shorty girl's a trooper
no matter what I need her to do, she be like "Super!"
own his own throne, the boss like King Koopa
on the microphone he flossed the ring "Super!
average emcees is like a TV blooper
MF DOOM... hes like D.B. Cooper
out wit the moolah, I let her get a outfit
jus to cool her off she said niggaz ain't about shit
I wonder if she meant it, I doubt it
the way it be in her mouth, she can't live witout it
and can't live with this, handle yo bidness
villain'll stay on a scandalous hoes shit list
one pack of cookies please Mr. Hooper
its fun smackin rookies, he is the "Super!"
look like a black wookie when he let his beard grow
weirdo, brown skin'ded always kept his hair low
rumor has it its a S-curl accident
DOOM was always known to keep the best girls backs bent
some say its the eyes, some say the accent
a lotta guys wonder where they stacks went
I call her thunder thighs, with the fatty swolla
only mess wit high rollas, do what daddy told her
no matter the city she with me to do the thang thang
work in the coochie, hooptie chitty chitty bang bang
same name on the titty as on the name ring
pretty like Baby D off "all in the same gang"
keep my eye on her really don't trust her
but I treat her like a daughter, taught her how to bust a nut
and the heat to turn beef to horsemeat chalupa
teach her how to hold it, of course he is the "Super!"
see most cats treat her like foofer
or beat her to a stupor, take it from the "Super!"
ya need to make her feel cuter
and lay down the G like Luther, everythin'll be "Super!"
do for her, keep her in a new fur
so she look sweet when she go to meet the "Super!"
got the buddha get the Grenadiers, twist it
put it in the air, come 'ere, kiss it
listen here scooter, let her try to bag you
when she's on the rag never let her fry the Ragu
which will have you under some type of spell crying "dag boo"
her name on ya back in her tattoo
whether a bourgie broad, nerd hoe, street chick
don't call her wifey if you met her at the freaknick
you don't want her don't waste her time, I'll dupe her
oh and be a father to ya child like the "Super!"
he keep his hoes in check
sends 'em out to get glows from off frozen necks
tell 'em take his clothes, leave him posin nekkid for real
better yet, get 'em for the check off the record deal
find out where he keep the tek an the blue steel
make sure for extra wreck let 'em know how you feel
and while he's runnin down to all star weekend to ball
I'm comin with the U-HAUL!(Super!)
(.Super!) (...Super!)


We do not have the lyrics for Cellz yet.


Already woke, spared a joke, barely spoke
rarely smoke
Stared at folks when properly provoked
mirror broke
Here, share strawberry morning, gone an more important spawning
poor men sworn in
Cornish hens
switching positions,
auditioning morticians
ignoring prison
Ignoramuses enlist and sound dumb

Found 'em drowned in cow's dung, crowns flung
Rings a Tinkerbell
sing for things that's frail as a fingernail
Bring a scale, stale ginger lingers
Seven figures
invigor
Nigga, fresh from out the jail, alpha male
Sickest ninja injury this century, enter plea
Lend sympathy to limper Simple Simon rhyming emcees
Trees is free, please leave a key
These meagre fleas, he's the breeze
And she's the bees knees
for sheez
G's of G's
Seize property, shopper sprees, chop the cheese
Drop the grease to stop diseases, gee wiz pa!
DOOM rock grammar like the kumbaya
Mama was a ho hopper
papa was a Rolling Stone star like Obama
Pull a card like oh drama
Civil liberties
These little titties abilities riddle me
middle C
Give a MC a rectal hysterectomy
Lecture on removal of the bowels
foul technically
Don't expect to see the recipe
Until we receive the check as well as the collection fee
More wreck than section Z
What you expect to get for free?
Shit from me, history
The key, plucked it off the mayor
Chucked it in the ol' tar pit off La Brea, player
They say he's gone too far
DOOM'll catch em after Jumah on cue lacka!
Do whatcha gotta do, grarrrr
The rumors are not true, got two ma
No prob, got the job,
hot barred
Scotch Guard the bar with cotton swabs, dart lob
Jamaica trade in treats on the beach
Make a skeet til her feets meet
Can it be I stayed away too long?
Did you miss these rhymes when I was gone?
As you listen to these crazy tracks
Check them stats then you know where I'm at


Already woke, spared a joke, barely spoke
rarely smoke
Stared at folks when properly provoked
mirror broke
Here, share strawberry morning, gone an more important spawning
poor men sworn in
Cornish hens
switching positions,
auditioning morticians
ignoring prison
Ignoramuses enlist and sound dumb

Found 'em drowned in cow's dung, crowns flung
Rings a Tinkerbell
sing for things that's frail as a fingernail
Bring a scale, stale ginger lingers
Seven figures
invigor
Nigga, fresh from out the jail, alpha male
Sickest ninja injury this century, enter plea
Lend sympathy to limper Simple Simon rhyming emcees
Trees is free, please leave a key
These meagre fleas, he's the breeze
And she's the bees knees
for sheez
G's of G's
Seize property, shopper sprees, chop the cheese
Drop the grease to stop diseases, gee wiz pa!
DOOM rock grammar like the kumbaya
Mama was a ho hopper
papa was a Rolling Stone star like Obama
Pull a card like oh drama
Civil liberties
These little titties abilities riddle me
middle C
Give a MC a rectal hysterectomy
Lecture on removal of the bowels
foul technically
Don't expect to see the recipe
Until we receive the check as well as the collection fee
More wreck than section Z
What you expect to get for free?
Shit from me, history
The key, plucked it off the mayor
Chucked it in the ol' tar pit off La Brea, player
They say he's gone too far
DOOM'll catch em after Jumah on cue lacka!
Do whatcha gotta do, grarrrr
The rumors are not true, got two ma
No prob, got the job,
hot barred
Scotch Guard the bar with cotton swabs, dart lob
Jamaica trade in treats on the beach
Make a skeet til her feets meet
Can it be I stayed away too long?
Did you miss these rhymes when I was gone?
As you listen to these crazy tracks
Check them stats then you know where I'm at


The flow is towin? precision as a afrotrim
All big letters but it isn? t no acronym
Smack the thin grin off the chin for crack smokin?
DDT the first bar leave the track backbroken
Chrome grown men doing business with Anglo-Saxon men
Lack can swing but that banjo? s so relaxing as the wax spin
Hacking axes in the wind pretend it? s just a pen
See if you can pencil? em in
Tense? met your men on a fenced in sensed this is tens
The wheels fall off then it? s the end
Don? t get keelhauled in villain always been
Feel real genuine ballskin
Not to call the whole crowd out
There? s just a few chumps and you know who you are like a shoutout
Place them in your loud mouth and taste them like a pastry
Waste of space face hastily bowow gracefully
Disappear, reappear, and disappear again

Villain not is here he? s no Afro-American
If that? s the case he be a bald-headed African
Takin all the credit and jetted astro-travellin
Turn a man into a mannequin for afflackin
And bein Tough Actin Tinactin bluff jacking
He wears a mask so when you dodge his face
Each and every race could absorb the bass
In a place to be don? t believe the hyperbole
It? s like a murder spree get sniped verbally
And beat in the head with lead pipe languages
For street cred leave em for dead and angrosnitch
The slanks suggest it was the guy in the glasses
Who came to help the people with they minds in they asses
And sent trippin? get a grip like Spalding
These walls is thin feel genuine ballskin


Villain man never ran with krills in his hand and
Won't stop rockin' til he clocked in a gazillion grand
Tillin' the wasteland sands
Raps on backs of treasure maps stacks to the ceilin' fan
He rest when he's ashes
Ask em after ten miles of his goulashes, smashes stashes
Chip on his shoulder with a slip on holster.
A clip, a folder and his grip on a boulder bolster
They supposed ta know. It show when his aura glow
Get from out the row, when he get dough it's horrible
Time is money spend way save invest the fess
From ten case of cave with chicken chest S
Yes ya'll the dub will get your trickles
The best ballers pitch in to rub and get a nickels
But tut tut, he about to change the price again
It go up each time, he blow up like hydrogen
Villain here, have em shrillin' in fear
And won't stop top illin' til he a gazillionaire
Grillin' stare, yeah ya boy had drama
Got em on a mental plane, avoided bad karma
Once sold a inbred skinhead a nigga joke
Plus a brand new chrome smokin' with the triggers broke
I thought I told em "firing pins was separate"
He find out later when he tries to go an rep it
Took a Jehovah money for a Arabic Torah
Charged an advance to translate it and ignored it, sorta
One monkey don't stop no slaughter
A junkie want ta cop a quarter ton, run for the border
Know the drill, it ain't worth the overkill
Flow skill, still there's no thrill
Villa bill ya 10K bills in his pilla
Villa, when it gets realer, split the skrilla with...
Dilla, (Dilla) mix, mix, mix
Do a deal for kicks and get rich quick
Sketch lyric, bet 'cha by the nick on some vic
Ick from the drumstick, come with the dumb shtick
Sick slick, hidden in a book
The only way they find it if you're spittin' in a hook
Listen, don't look now, keep walkin'
Traded three beans for this cow, cheap talkin'
Hawk men stalkin' hear that we hawkin' often
Coughin to a coffin, might as well scoff the pork then
He's like Warf, some say stronger though
Off the top J strong bow, play along bro
Wear a mask like yo off the Gong Show
Flow slow as Mongo, Don Juan thong pro
For ya info when he's not practicin' Jim Crow
A actress and some nympho bimbo
He's playin' Ray Jay the old tape
DOOM - well what can I say like JJ in a gold cape
Fill it to the rim like brim
Villain and ya won't find him in no gym
Probably a foggy bog with the frogs
With a dot on the guard as he squat on log
Half cocked and half baked
Used to keep a full stock of work half rocked and half shake
My mistake, sign a track agreement
For more G's than lines and cracks in the cement
In any event it's fake like wrestlin'
Get em like Jake The Snake on mescalines
Ahem, elixir for the dry throat
Tried to hit the high note, Villain since a itsy bitsy zygote
By remote, send in the meat wagon
Braggin' MC's packed in with they feets draggin'
These stats are staggerin'
Had his PHD in indiscreet street hagglin'
Villain, his agenda is clear
Endin' this year with dividends to spare, here
It's not meant for the seein'
Went through the celin' after enterin' his center bein'
A new meanin' to sales through the roof
Guaranteed raw and saw his truth was truth, proof
It's the return of the tramp
Who do a duet jam when Earnest goes to camp
For the right earn - na'mean like Vern
We need some more oil for the machines to burn, learn
Jiminy crickets
He gets lucky like winnin' free tickets off sickly lyrics
One mans waste is another mans soap
Sons fan base know the brotha man's dope
A real weirdo with a bug rare flow
And the way his hair grow was ugly as a scarecrow
He wears a mask so the charge won't grab
On a rooftop with a large stone slab
Heads up, talk white and thought niggerish
Refuse to walk tight and got his off the vigorous'h
Black licorice and equally as yucky
How he handled the money was strictly Dan Stuckie
Monkey hustle, man on fire
Later for the date than the Hadron Collider
And cost more, it be singin' like a style
DOOM leave the competition steamin' like a pile
Smile, ding! Sparkling jewels
In effect like alternate side of the street parkin' rules
Fools, the roach was never dead
Live for a week, then dehydrate with a severed head
Instead it was depicted as flicked in
Split the wig, slit


Chain smokin beedies til his brain's broken completely
Get back on his feet, work out and eat some Wheaties
Greedy for the cheese, please, most couldn't fathom
Had em in the cobra clutch, when he spat the mad hymn gems
Collection of brats, timbs and hats
Had no time for the pitty pat, I'll give em that
The rhythm hit em back with a right hook
Shook it off, caught a shiner, thought it was a aight look
Depends on the shades, the end of days fades
Pretenders lay in dazes on stages
DOOM malaise
Eat it up, microphone, microwave mayonnaise
His own way was strange but it matters not
Tuned into a frequency tone that shattered rock
Hold it down like Shatner do Spock
Rapper jocks... need to put a sock in they chatter box
The block got lied to VIAC stock
Folks gather round it's no joke like knock knock
It's them, they came home to roost y'all
And watch em transform the game to the rules of foosball
She's too small. Any questions?
Him could squeeze blood from a penny in a recession
Keep guessin'
It gets deeper than depression
The power of suggestion awake or sleep, peep the lesson
Dig that beat
Ripped it with metal fingers and stomped it with big fat feet
And you know what they say: cut the hay
Resistance is futile, you will be assimilated, but today it's all grey
Metallic wood or ruby stone
Rude like the type of dude you could write a movie on
Hardcore porn - did his own stunts
Read his own rhymes, and split his own blunts
Once... in a while, every other minute
Eyes pop out, Popeye, heavy on the spinach
Steady on his business, and ready with a ill pitch
Keep some bad bills niche like Denny Kuci 'nils' nich
No hitch, just a shitload of spit and sneeze
Strictly G's stackin up, off the rack of hidden fees
Rappers like the gay club strip tease
With hippies on the yip sayin "hey bub grip these"
They screamin for attention
Deemin' at the mention of a scary demon convention
You could cut the tension wit a switchblade
And serve it on a same plate of hors d'oeuvres a witch made
Filleted, pursuaded the chamber maid
To bet her paycheck on a get naked game of spades
Straight up, no chaser, no layaways
Caution: faint taste of microwave mayonnaise


"Yeah, here we go... just go with the flow" 

Yo, I'd like to check this microphone before I start right quick
Microphone check 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2

Big up all the Monsta Island massive
And beware before I triple dare you like the last kid
Who ask me what we don't got that you got son
For one, flow that's elementary my dear Wat-son
Secondly, ever since I was little
Not so much to riddle, least rhyme to the syllable
Keep tracks that make a Arab thief clap
With no hands, I chop these drums off
Truly yours, G Rap
Actual fact, relax
In this land of lyrical loss, black
I'm not the cool sleet stack
The one who might stop and talk to you
Poison to few, niggas who be bitin styles I'm like pork to
Oooh... what you got to lose? Let mud fly
When I got blues I chew whole crews that's bud dry
So I ask why the style's from the cess
Shit be fuckin with my eye as I pull it to the chest
The super muthafuckin' villain grip the mic wit an iron hand
Throwin emcees to the fire from out da fryin' pan
It ain't no use in tryin, man
Son, stop cryin
Frontin' like you death-defyin'
You need to stop lyin'
Speak your piece only once you're spoken to first
Now lemme hear your verse while I'm chokin' you
With bubbly fine rhymes like a editor
Throw them to my collection of skulls and spines like Predator
Fuck around, the only niggas who could hear the same sound (who?)
Was Jet Jaguar and James Brown
(Yeah, yeah only them two niggas?)
And I'm glad I took the time to write their names down to big 'em up
(True, true)

I'd like to say hi
It's fly the odd Merlin
That's quick to whip up a script like Rod Sterling
 bad bitch who used to whip the Sterling
Who see God?, never see God earlin'
My man Grimm had his little monkey like Space Ghost
Me myself I got flavors that out-taste most
With numb gums, some rhymers is lake toast
Back to you MF Doom, you late show host
S to the U to the P E R-uh
Who chronicle these times in a 3-D horror
 co-star or in a realer drama
Who break bread with stingy kin-men, indian borrower
Lone gunmen who candidly flip fly floes
Single-handedly with one eye closed
In a fly pose, no shirt 
May see me stack the quarter-mill cash pay
That's in a smash way how he did it
Muthafucka probably couldn't peep it past a minute

Ladies

Mary, you make me wanna eat you
Every time I see you, it's like the first time I meet you
Fragrance like a flower, subtle and sweet too
Seductive and whatever, it might as well be see through

Like my genie in a bottle
Miss could get me rich like a magaziney model
Before you know it, he have her on a stroll
Fresh and ripe, perplexin' like Acapulco Gold

If I had to guess, just right, not a day old
Like a cradle robber, copped her off, shop a trailer load
Know the right number, you can get her
And hit while you would've sold to the highest bidder like

Fruits and berries, bring daddy loot in a hurry
Just be cute and don't worry
Type to make a nigga hallucinate and admit it
Then she started losing weight, lettin' everybody hit it

I like Ally, sometimes she gets bitter
Always kept me happy, never had a problem with her
She used to let me use her, back when I was looser
Respect her to this day, and never did abuse her

I told her I'll be faithful, but she don't believe me
I probably coulda been, if I never meet Eevee
She make me feel all fuzzy inside, it's loco
You won't get nowheres near her if you're broke though

Kept a shorty, can't find 'em much thinner
If caught I get mad time just for touchin' her
Knock wood, so much for hymens
So fly, she should be in the sky with diamonds

Little young thing, she likes to do the tongue thing
At times, she would play hard to get, grunting
Or something, she made me feel like the number one king
Run into her now, and we still catch a fun fling

Met her at Central Park this one time
Had the God mentally sparked, reflectin' sunshine
She said, you need to stop messin' wit that white girl
She fuckin' wit ya head and got ya heart in tight curl

We messed around once or twice, but she don't know me
She helped me get money at the Dutch price OT
Plus she from Columbia, so she really Spanish
Cookie known to make a cat bank account vanish

And Miss Hazy, all the women mature black
Every time she sees me, I end up gettin' pulled back
All she want me to do is blaze it crazy
The only one complaint is, she make me too lazy

Sugar mommy laced me with the butter Navy Avi
Just her way to makeup for the headaches that she gave me
It's all gravy, when I'm done getting my mack on
Ally is always there to help me get back on

Ladies


So... You know when you gonna come in?
Nobody who never ever ever lose it you know (Uh huh, uh huh)
Cos the more you know, the more you know that you don't know shit (Uh huh, uh huh)
Niggas'll never run out of shit
So much shit, so much scripts we do here
We just never run out of shit

Enjoy the roller coaster ride.

Multifaceted...

Uh huh, walk the...

c (knowledge me)
My mind is Heaven's gate so enter me (enter me)
My mind is the gate ta Hell so try ta flee (try ta flee)
Both gates look da same, which will it be? (which will it be?)
Demons screams from thought process
Enter semen, Child born stress
Body want ta sleep but da mind can't rest
Measure, pleasure through financial progress
When it come ta currency, love is nonexistent
Foes modify, Friends become so distance
Some hope ya die, back-stabbed in an instant
Foes I despise, disguised as Allies
ta sabotage camouflage
Loyalty is lies
Ta see God, look inta my eyes
Ta see the Devil in you, look inta my eyes
as I rise from Hell's equator

'Cause I'mma slow it up, speed it up, slow it up, speed it up
Metal Finger's feed beats Grimm Reaper eat 'em up
Speed 'em up, slow 'em up, speed 'em up, slow 'em up
Brainsick, Tick, Tick, Tick, MF blow it up
Slow it up, speed it up, slow it up, speed it up
Metal Finger's feed beats Grimm Reaper eat it up
Speed 'em up, slow 'em up, speed 'em up, slow 'em up
Brainsick, Tick, Tick, Tick, MF blow it up

Take air, compress it, bless it
Mix loops like Ku Klux
MF don't give two fucks
Nigga, quarterback blitz, poped, quickly fumble
Leave game with concussion, seein' stars and mumbles
This happens, ta any Emcee that want's ta rumble
Dynasty's destroyed like Carrington's and Colby's
Noise, reduced, MF thinks in Dolby
Chop that ass in half like Obi Wan Kenobi
Greatest of all time, God straight up told me
Greatest of all time, the Devil even told me
Icicles on surfaces of sun/Son, we livin' coldly
Prophets be phony
And we attact, we switch like the Wu-Tang symbol
Still kill Jack even though Quick and Nimble plain and simple
Pick Niggaz off while they ballin' and die old like stallin', yes
Death I hear ya callin', I accept collect
Human sacrifice, must pay respect
We catch reck Nigga, we catch reck
And... we gonna... gonna...

Slow it up, speed it up, slow it up, speed it up
Mettle Finger's feed beats Grimm Reaper eat it up
Speed 'em up, slow 'em up, speed 'em up, slow 'em up
Brainsick, Tick, Tick, Tick, MF blow it up
BOOM!
MF Grimm, MF Doom!


I only play the games that I win at
And stay the same with more rhymes than there's ways to skin cats
As a matter of fact, let me rephrase
With more rhymes and more ways to fillet felines these days
Watch the path of the black one
Supervillian he wrecks clubs for dell
In a drunken stupor chillin
Ready and willin to inadvertantly foil that plan of any rhymer, whiner or
spoiled brat
Who got more snottier flows than snotty nose?
And holds mics like he knows karate body blows
Nobody knows the trouble I see
from the MPB fly dirty tailin the eye bubble eye thirty
For the record this is some shit I just thought of y'all
Science fiction that's not admissable in no court of law
I live to rock mics 3-D
The only reason I seek to stop to snuff the TV
I heard beats, they sound like karaoke
With monkey rhymers on a leash like don't have this fairy choke me
Hit 'em with a penny so we can get these peanuts
And I thought we was nuts, I used to get free cuts
They locks Lex Luthor up in green haven
Since when a nigga never really been to clean shaven
Misbehavin rap stars need mistament
Call me Mista Bent
I'm at where your sister went
Intelligent, used to write and be well spoke
Now all a nigga wanna do is fight and sell, tell a joke
This could lead to catastrophe
Bout to stop the violence right after these last three shots from the black
bat got me at headlock
Holdin on to sanity while stranded at dreadlock
She told me get off I said
Bitch, let me set this shit off so I could get rich right quick
Then it hit me like the point of intoxication
Nigga come out and rock this nation like oxifacen
A lot of niggas out is rusty like oxidation
In the world's most strangest most dangerous occupation
But you could do it, you the Super like in your building
Villian like trife kingdom wear and all my children
Plottin and it sure to pay ends
With some more mature womens and more of they friends
And when bad men roll tight, it's actual true
Like a pack of big bamboo with natural glue
Who grip necks of becks next to triple X
He just came before D followed the ripple effects
And it'll lead you right to him
Oh snap, it seems you walked into a trap do wrap
Zoinks, this place is filled with pretender willies
One false move and get broke off like end of phillies
True believers ain't nothin new to a
Crook with special powers like how to tell the future uh uh
Rhyme of the month two page long
Bustin off two gages with my cake gone wrong
Son it's on remind me of a Raekwon tape song
With a fleet of super bad status Rae Dawn Chong
Let me know if y'alls with me y'all
Nasty yo and geographic down to the titty bar
Rap monster outer city y'all
To all my brothers who is doin' unsettling bids
You could have got away with it if it was not for them meddling kids


What is the magic that makes ones eyes sparkle and gleam?
Light up the skies, the name of the game is lightworks
I see you're peein' in you pants little sissy boy

Jerks, welcome to the octagon, lay a player
Flat before the trainer felt his clock was on
Keep your socks torn, it's a box-a-thon
With hard rock, black, Rock and Ron's gon' barbizon

Curled up beggin', layin' on the canvas
Instead of in the ready position like praying mantis
Scissors, landvis, grand fist, sandwich, Stan switch
Slammed on stitches switch hands, inch, damn snitch

Any street corner could be the platform
Till we defeat gone and wander
Watch your mouth jaw southpaw outs floor
Doubt your clout more bout roar outscore boy

Off the leash like UFC
Off the beat off ya feet like two lefties
FUB's heifer, please, lost a few to stew beef
New referees, what a remarkable team sold ya teeth

The shine that sparkles and gleams
Light up the signs, the name of the game is the lightworks
Light up the spliffs, the name of the game is lightworks

Wipe off slight smirks, the match was mapped out
Get jabbed and crap slapped out tapped out
Either the lunch bin or choke hold tie
Time munchkins get punched in like vocal rhyme

The shine that sparkles and gleams
Light up the signs, the name of the game is the lightworks
Light up the spliffs, the name of the game is lightworks

The right hurts


"Things take a turn for the worse"
 "Send him back where he came from"
"We got shots fired down the street"

Ba-di-yahhhh...
"Alright, steady"
Ba-di-yah, ba-di-yah

Absolute power corrupts absolutely
If they get the Villain surrounded {*AHEM*}

Good to the last drop nigga
Hood 'til the last pop them bigot-ass piglets
Go for the bosses, dicks or higher
Beatwalker still get caught up in the crossfire
Get at the sarge, he give the orders
The rest of them punks'll quit the force or get slaughtered
Use stealth, play alleys, jet
We'd rather not alert them gnomes and federales, yet
Keep the local random cases in each state
Escape to the beaches for the season and be straight
You on call, keep your Nikes on tight, no white
Anybody tell get lighted on sight
The ringer's on a need-to-know basis
No persons, places, things and no faces
Get bagged, you're on your own, act it alone
Back home your fam'll be provided for while you're gone
It's a price on all snitches
If you nice bring back eyes fingers toes and pictures
Send copies to those who singin the blues
Mothers and fathers who's unjustly accused
Our species is in danger
Wear gloves and strike in a city where you a stranger
That'll let them fools know
And send them a message, let them P.O.W.'s go
Absolute power corrupts absolutely
Now you have your orders, do your duty
A new way to let the shot spray
A few drops a day, double expresso, D.A. latte
No smell nor taste, hardly traceable
Wait to waste a prosecutor, maybe get the case pulled
Learn 'em a lesson for givin bros mad stressings
A long list of C.O.'s names and addresses
A fake judge for many years on the bench
Who sent some good cats to the chair, who erred in the trench
They say her tongue was teared out, smeared and drench
The whole system scared in doubt in a fear stench
And she was tortured, some say post mortem
The suspect took his own life before they caught him
It's real spooky like a real trife movie
Remember the part where Terminator killed Tookie
Absolute power corrupts absolutely
If they get the Villain surrounded, son this year
Shed blood, some'll be shooken
Just look with they head in the mud, red flood

"Villain"

One of the things we ran into the unknown
We we couldn't get at the door pulled as quick as we wanted to
And once we did, finally pull the door and breach the interior door
There's a man trapped inside of it
Basically that man trap is a cage
'Fore we run in, we're stuck in there and they can shoot us
While we're just, we're stuck in a cage


So we're gonna stand on perimeter
We did have some shots fired right down the street on us
While this was goin on, so we gotta set up a tight perimeter
We got the streets blocked off
To make sure we don't have any drivebys on us
Other than that, the operation went, fairly well...
Who told you that? Rolled through, BRRRAT
Old to the new knows who hold the hat
Custom tailored fitted, head stayed same size
Big since first born, well spend to game wise
Same guys, same disguise, sick aim eye stare
A thick dame thighs, click claim prize
And the lucky contestant was sent
A whole year's supply of buckets of yucky excrement
Digital format, provide the ROM
Riot calm
flow was like a roadside bomb
Flipped the Humvee, impact was limb-numbing
Cameraman wig back, gunner screaming INCOMING
RPG, rhyme propelled grenade
Time to yell, scramble for cover in the shade
Bright as the midday sun, then it fade
Darkness come quick, some run and get sprayed
Rot dead, hot lead, it's rainin
Left 'em with they brains kicked in with they trainin
Dragged the remains into the open by the bootstraps
Dogtag attached to explosive human booby traps
Where's air support, ears ringin, mortars whistlin
Bloodshot vision after thought abort mission
Too little too late, as the last man gushed
Took no prisoners mushed, rap ambush
(MURDALIZING SUCKER EMCEES~!)

In the world's most strangest most dangerous occupation
But you could do it, you the Super like in your building
Villian like trife kingdom wear and all my children
Plottin and it sure to pay ends
With some more mature womens and more of they friends
And when bad men roll tight, it's actual true
Like a pack of big bamboo with natural glue
Who grip necks of becks next to triple X
He just came before D followed the ripple effects
And it'll lead you right to him
Oh snap, it seems you walked into a trap do wrap
Zoinks, this place is filled with pretender willies
One false move and get broke off like end of phillies
True believers ain't nothin new to a
Crook with special powers like how to tell the future uh uh
Rhyme of the month two page long
Bustin off two gages with my cake gone wrong
Son it's on remind me of a Raekwon tape song
With a fleet of super bad status Rae Dawn Chong
Let me know if y'alls with me y'all
Nasty yo and geographic down to the titty bar
Rap monster outer city y'all
To all my brothers who is doin' unsettling bids
You could have got away with it if it was not for them meddling kids


Ladies

Mary, you make me wanna eat you
Every time I see you, it's like the first time I meet you
Fragrance like a flower, subtle and sweet too
Seductive and whatever, it might as well be see through

Like my genie in a bottle
Miss could get me rich like a magaziney model
Before you know it, he have her on a stroll
Fresh and ripe, perplexin' like Acapulco Gold

If I had to guess, just right, not a day old
Like a cradle robber, copped her off, shop a trailer load
Know the right number, you can get her
And hit while you would've sold to the highest bidder like

Fruits and berries, bring daddy loot in a hurry
Just be cute and don't worry
Type to make a nigga hallucinate and admit it
Then she started losing weight, lettin' everybody hit it

I like Ally, sometimes she gets bitter
Always kept me happy, never had a problem with her
She used to let me use her, back when I was looser
Respect her to this day, and never did abuse her

I told her I'll be faithful, but she don't believe me
I probably coulda been, if I never meet Eevee
She make me feel all fuzzy inside, it's loco
You won't get nowheres near her if you're broke though

Kept a shorty, can't find 'em much thinner
If caught I get mad time just for touchin' her
Knock wood, so much for hymens
So fly, she should be in the sky with diamonds

Little young thing, she likes to do the tongue thing
At times, she would play hard to get, grunting
Or something, she made me feel like the number one king
Run into her now, and we still catch a fun fling

Met her at Central Park this one time
Had the God mentally sparked, reflectin' sunshine
She said, you need to stop messin' wit that white girl
She fuckin' wit ya head and got ya heart in tight curl

We messed around once or twice, but she don't know me
She helped me get money at the Dutch price OT
Plus she from Columbia, so she really Spanish
Cookie known to make a cat bank account vanish

And Miss Hazy, all the women mature black
Every time she sees me, I end up gettin' pulled back
All she want me to do is blaze it crazy
The only one complaint is, she make me too lazy

Sugar mommy laced me with the butter Navy Avi
Just her way to makeup for the headaches that she gave me
It's all gravy, when I'm done getting my mack on
Ally is always there to help me get back on

Ladies


Smack it up, flip it, pulled out, 'bout to fell
Sunday in the A-T-L and I'm all outta ale
Like a bat out of hell,
tripped on a cat tail
Mutt drinkin out a pail, who let the rat out the cell?
Got all the ingredients and recipe, might as well
Since last week the bootlegger been in jail
If all else fail, inhale the L
Makin sure they can't see your sale via
snail mail
Mind like a sewer
servin rhyme on a skewer
DOOM'll step to a fine dime like he knew her
"My black sister"
She said "Step back" before he kissed her
She did the dipper and the smack just missed her
There go a list of politics like Henry Kissinger
99% of rap is just a friendly listener
I'm like these dudes must have some screws loose to hate y'all
Or a couple of ounces short of deuce-deuce or 8 Ball
Y'all know it's time for the end, when the day come
Buy an album, get rudely insulted over fake drums
Same CD's you get for free, you break 'em
Wa-alaikum
make 'em eat they food like steak'um
Why she wanna ask me if I could pass the paprika?
One hand on the mic, the other on the
beaker
Every week or so peeked out the lab though
eureka
A technique to keep somethin uniquer in your speaker
For yo' information, I didn't do the beat y'all
It ain't my fault, if she didn't move her feet at all
Skeeter, robbed Peter to pay Paul
trick
it on Mary so she can
play ball
... Better have my
scrilla
And cut it out with all that funny hand jive will ya?
All this trouble for a tall glass of Olde E
Drink it all fast, make you haul ass slowly
Remind me to remember what you told me
Holey moley, did you get a load of her Roley Poley?
Yo G, remind me to remember what you told me
Whoever don't feel him, Feel balls like a goalie
One for the money, two for the
better green
Methylenedioxymethamphetamine
Told the knock kneed ghetto queen
Medallin and use oxcyocetaline
Who needs airplay, it's all just hearsay
Leave a wig like it was having a bad hair day
Miracle glide master, asked him what's his secret
He said 'Shasta', and turned to formaldehyde faster
When I'm home with my lady, I try to duke her daily
One night she tried to flail me with her ukulele
Pack your heat
the Villain on the cover of Black Beat
With a bunch of crackers and some snack meat
They better have my scrilla
Cut it out with all that funny hand jive will ya?
All this trouble for a tall glass of Olde E
Drink it all fast, make you haul ass slowly
Remind me to remember what you told me
Holey moley, did you get a load of her roley poley?
Yo G, remind me to remember what you told me


Forgive them Lord for they know not what they spit
All lucky contestants on the mic sounds nice, but they get
Or we have a beat for one time wonder hit
And a “how to play it off if you make a live blunder kit”
And the winner for the ninth time in a row
Doom, I owe it to a well refined rhyme flow
Now if you don’t mind, dough
Find me where the limes grow
With a fine dime,
fill in the blanks
Still no necklace, mill in the bank
Grill stay blank,
not to be critical but ill they stank
Maybe give them thanks from the steel grade shank
Hold that, put the mic down ya luck’s up
Don’t let it touch the ground and shut the…
Door,
buckle up it’s the law fool
Stay calm like you got pulled over with the raw
If he had thick hair like Ric Flair (checkin?)
Wouldn’t know if hoes really cared for the…
Lyrical skills that’s how they judge it
Trick the deals until they take it out the budget
mother…
Fudge it like the numbers on the number one Billboard hit
And still be bored as…
it could be worse this verse a no rehearse
Doom’ll snatch the mic like “no me first”
They get sloppy seconds after we stop wreckin'
And they had a choppy check in
Then they ripped the beat like a surgery botched
A hurter he murder flows,
Doom off the crotch
I’ll be back in two and two, watch the clock
They thought we had Koch, how ya block got blotch
Another notch on the Glock
His own stock in the strip club
Free scotch on the rocks beoyotchh!


We do not have the lyrics for More Rhymin yet.


Indefinitely, concieved in LKC,
See Archangel in Infinities, white T reeking of Hennessy,
brought back memories, father locked north up,
Mom's snort up her crack remedy,
lack remedies be just what I did,
no school, no cool
No fool, but fuck politics,
Dead prez educated hit shit I lit the dollars with,
Hard Boiled, Chow Yum,
Fat boiled hard since six,
Rather on a brick during class,
my ass'd never sit,
and give a, fuck bout Hitler,
Caesar, Ask the teacher,
why am I need of knowing this?
Cant you tell the judge hold my books,
and I'm the crook on his corner, bitch?
"Rolling fats with Chronomats shining on my wrist?"
Til, I got caught up by all the law's of his,
Incarcerated cause Tre's and stained papes and weight,
yeah, I was harboring,
Got out to find out,
neighbour kids'd been fathered in,
Water of repentance used for college of the selling,
Live from proudest felons marking lives with dots,
and popping off on em like melons,
fuck that now, man I'm grown and shit,
Fuse Mic's like dynamite but never bomb
This rap shit, I find credits in,
route blocked by hoes, past the prime elegance,
Hobo's with kids clothes trading them off for medicine,
One goal is all's endevour, man,
alling is for weak,
Dragged rags through my hall's ducking calls of the beast,
Got away, I'm clean and debt free,
I ball, ya best believe,
Box the socks off ya, Heavy Weight G stopper,
but all bars and heavy beats,
ain't got me away from my scars and memories,


Yo
I'm only rhyming where the drums is at
Y'all niggaz think y'all slick wit that bullshit bump that
Y'all pay V for flowing to the beat
Not for what he know that got hoe's hoeing in the streets
That's for him to know and for they to never find out

About the kidnap, blind fold, and the blind mouse
The coroner report say he simply signed out oh
And I know
Y'all wanna see a wino bring the wine out
Cat wit a dead mouse is how he catch the phrase
And pause plays wit it kill it
And eat off it for days kid it

Who ever ain't get it ain't supposed to
For standing still close to
Bandits will ghost you no shoot Sherlock
I don't know how they do on your block

Out here we rock on to the sure shot
Shit still ain't stop keep it on till your peeps is gone
We be on the creep no matter what you keep it on
CD whop

Peep catch the beat to ridiculously
People think he study levitations true mystery
How to power an envious scallon till
He got him for his sweet 16
He said Ed be wilding

Rumor has it things got violent
He clobbered him and broke the fuck out
But he ain't try to rob him
I told her don't tell your man that's
The trouble with these chicks
Next experiment

Twelve strands from double helix
No I haven't seen Kess Felix
Oh, yeah
You stay away from her with those lyrics
Please
Ain't nobody fucking after her

I'm out of here as soon as I fix the flux capacitor
N O N and speak to V in a proper manner
Before he stabs ya and put out all type of proper gander
Stop the slander chop the hand of a thief
And cut the mouth off of who ever comes out they teeth

V sell time to an inmate
And then tell him a rhyme for the hell of it to demonstrate
They know who's the renown beat critic
Do a street lyric like that's a neat trick
Off on a tangent he ain't got a cent

Supposed to go to management
And spent it getting bent sparky
I had enough of your malarkey
For one don't mark me and who you calling darky
Agitate in the dark




By the way
I re-up on bad dreams
Bag up screams in fiftys
Be up on mad schemes
That heat shop like jiffy-pop(pop)
In a instant
Get smoked like Winston
Cigarettes
Ho's get ripped off like Nicorette
(patch)
In real life
The real trife scene
Might snatch ya life like assault machine
Rifle
Dead up setup like bull-fight
Be blunted how we like
Couldn't white or in full flight
The unemotional
Call me anti-social
On the run off the gun
Death tally commercial
Death valley
Is like rehearsal to the streets
To my peeps
G.M
MF on the beat
Rhymes
Is chosen like the weapons of war
So keep from steppin on my floor
Or delivery
Front door
I bring it to ya'll motherfuckers
Master yours
My disaster cause:
Hell.. in gas drawls
The supervillain
Cooler than a million
I be chillins
Still quick to slice squares like Sicilians
Dont make me have to hurt them feelings
I'll ruin you in the dirt that I be doin in my dealings (WHILE I’M)
Sendin spirits through the ceilin'-
Chrome peelin'-
Dome blown
Within the comforts of your own home
Grown big
Wheelin' and high rollin'
I hold the lye-
It keeps the sty on my eye swollen'

Holdin
Foldin the pal
Known as massive-versatile
I’d like to big-em-up monster isle

Uummm
Yeah

I saw you in hell with them gas drawls
Mhm

To my brother Subroc-
And black ju I crack brew for-
Two more, three men, two up
I hit the brew up like-
Nobody knoowwss
How X the unseen feels
When giving crews a brush with death like between meals
Two times a day
Wit brothers thats tight like a noose
Wit more rhymes in use than Dr. Seuss
Or motherfuckin' mother goose
X - the suspicious flirter
Who every hooker hearda'
Next to malicious murda'
A track type vicious
Fulfillin the pipe wishes
The misses may be legal
Minus the baby eagle
Any given summers eve-
Dont breathe
Sixteen shots I do believe-
And one up the sleeve
Master of the O
Who predict ya last pause-
I told ya'll
Hell and gas drawls-
Breakin-
Glass and plastic jaw-
Like federal drastic law
Fed up from fightin' secret war
Wit' them fantastic four-
(invisible bitch)
Versus Doom wit' the metal face
Before I go to state
The ho better settle case
The flow is at pedal pace
Steady like tricycles
Beware all suckas is froze like icicles
(bag 'em up)
And baggin' bitches like nickels
Cause I licked 'em where they tickle
Before I hit the clit though I'mma split till I pronounce
More hits than a ounce no doubt
About ta bounce
X the unannounced-
Im out

AndIlike to give a shoutout
To the brother Jet Jaguar
Megalon
And King Geedorah

I call this joint right here
Gas Drawls
In hell wit yours




"And that ended Doom's plans for world destruction!"
"And how did you manage to stop him?"
"Simple, I [..] rearranged the circuits"
"Once he threw the switch" {*bang*}
"My ability to attack is faster than the cobra..." {*dialogue fades*}

"Very helpful."
"And I will be careful, not to make the same mistakes as Doom!"

What's the hero, who's the villain?
Dead or livin, killed or killin, who the fuck should remain chillin?
(Doom) Webster says, wicked and evil, but yo who's Webster?
Nihilation and outcast, equals freedom that's so fast
Culture in chains, that be the rolls villain plays
All these are just metaphors, they describe symbols in folklore
But who knows why it's like this?
Hero? Hit or old miss? Maybe it's all good
Really of God, but who should, determine the real
Evil, what's the deal
Fools rush in, they don't know the yin, from the yang
And are ashamed to deviate, or act sane
From the norm, they are slaves, forced to conform
To really find your essence, take this as a lesson
Break away from the rest of them
Get from the form ending, like the villain in the song
Find truth, who determines wrong
From right, without a fistfight
Different from day than from night {Operation... Doomsday}
It's just a simple play on words
Delete all these punks ass herbs
Who's the hero, what's the villain?
The question still remains chillin
Listen to the music, try very hard to use it
Open up and research, and that's the end of this verse
But y'all niggas keep y'all minds open out there

"So like fuck you, fuck the newspaper, fuck all that shit man!"
"I'm leavin" {"Good evening"}
"Yo why you want to be leaving man?"
"Man don't worry about that sucker, yo man listen"
"Yo I'm not gonna finish my piece man, not with this lady around man"
"Yo what the fuck is this shit man?"
"I don't like that shit man, I don't want no fuckin pictures taken of my shit man"
"Yo relax!"
"Nah man, that shit is fucked up man, that shit can get us busted over here man!"
"Relax man it's for the paper"
"NAH NAH I'm not gonna relax, I'm gettin the fuck out of here"
"Look, we got a car! She's got a car parked right over there man!"
"Let's get the fuck out of here!"
"Well come on let's go then!"

"Doom, .. to conceal his own mangled form, right?" "Yeah"
"So like fuck you"
"Do yourself a favor.. do yourself.. trust me"




Beef rap, could lead to getting teeth capped
Or even a wreath for ma dukes on some grief crap
I suggest you change your diet
It can lead to high blood pressure if you fry it
Or even a stroke, heart attack, heart disease
It ain't no starting back once arteries start to squeeze
Take the easy way out phony, until then
They know they wouldn't be talking that baloney in the bullpen
So disgusting, pardon self as I discuss this
They talk a wealth of shit and they ain't never seen the justice
Bust this, like a cold milk from out the toilet
Two batteries some Brillo and some foil, he'a boil it
He be better off on PC glued
And it's a feud so don't be in no TV mood
Every week it's mystery meat, seaweed stewed
(Food, we need food!)

He wears a mask just to cover the raw flesh
A rather ugly brother with flows that's gorgeous
Drop dead joints hit the whips like bird shit
They need it like a hole in they head or a third tit
Her bra smell, his card say: aw hell
Barred from all bars and kicked out the Carvel
Keep a cooker where the jar fell
And keep a cheap hooker that's off the hook like Ma Bell
Top bleeding, maybe fella took the loaded rod gears
Stop feeding babies colored sugar-coated lard squares
The odd pair swears and God fears
Even when it's rotten, we've gotten through the hard years
I wrote this note around New Year's
Off a couple a shots and a few beers, but who cares?
Enough about me, it's about the beats
Not about the streets and who food he about to eat
A rhyming cannibal who's dressed to kill and cynical
Whether is it animal, vegetable, or mineral
It's a miracle how he get so lyrical
And proceed to move the crowd like a old Negro spiritual
For a mil' do a commercial for Mello Yello
Tell 'em devil's hell no, sell y'all own Jello
We hollow krills, she swallow pills
He follow flea collar three dollar bills
And squeal for halal veal, 80-dollar pill
Dig the real, it's how the big ballers deal
Twirl a L after every meal (FOOD!)

What up?
To all rappers: shut up with your shutting up
And keep your shirt on, at least a button-up
Yuck, is they rhymers or strippin' males?
Out of work jerks since they shut down Chippendales
They chippin' nails, DOOM, tippin' scales
Let alone the pre-orders that's counted off shippin' sales
This one goes out to all my peoples skippin' bail
Dippin' jail, whippin' tail, and sippin' ale
Light the doobie 'till it glow like a ruby
After which they couldn't find the Villain like Scooby
He's in the lab on some old Buddha Monk shit
Overproof drunk shit, and who would'a thunk it?
Punk, try and ask why ours be better
Could be the iron mask or the Cosby sweater
Yes, you, who's screwed by the dude on the CD, nude (We need food!)

It's horrible
One little evening alone, home
End up with carpal tunnel syndrome
And here I am, known for giving heavy back aches
Grown and living off of Little Debbie snack cakes
Supposed to be checking e-mails
All I got is messages from ass naked females

I don't know a Jenny, she said it's free and I won't owe her a penny
And that's the last time I saw her
But thousands of more horrors on online Gomorrah
And Sodom
They got 'em with they curls out
And they got a better sales pitch than the Girl Scouts
I wonder what I owe her
For a whole box of caramel coconut samoa

"Nite nite!"

Uh, ok honey, sweet dreams! Now it's time to get serious like Peek Freans
A metal hand full, wipe it on the quilt
Wife wake up and I'm kill't over spilt milk
Locked in, looking at your picture
Fully clothed winter and I right there wit cha
Thinking about the last time I split your wishbone
A man could only wish you could do the same 'til he get home
Fat chance
At least he get snacks
That will have to do 'til a brother get back
Until then, smack One-Eyed Jack
And hope one of his peoples can hook him with a tri-pack
That's three different flavors
Chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry wafers
Acting all hard, bout to get beat up
I'll show him what time it is once I get this sheet up
Soon as he fell off the beat down
All I hear is (13th cell, put the sheet down)
Damn C.O.,
What the hell do she know
Besides the fact she wanna get dug out on the d-low
A workaholic with a fountain in the ink pen
Out in the mountains and I stopped drinking again
In the wee hours he's gotten farther
Needing three showers, being hot and bothered
The whiz with her legs bent, pregnant
God bless the day she wondered where her egg went
I need a L, it's hard to drink without it
And could use some kookies but trying not to think about it
Watching "BET" on jazz for knowledge on file
Every other commercial, college hoes gone wild
Soft batch, I prefer the other bunch, like we got for lunch
Chocolate fudge butter crunch

He don't mess with the Ritz Bits, Wheat Thins, Saltines, or Triscuits
Matzos, or Cheez-Its
Catch sugar fits every time that he sees
Chips Ahoy, double chocolate chunk
Something with the bubble and the junk in the trunk
Even the Oreos
No matter what weather
Always kept 'em dipped in milk and stuck together
In the game he's shameless, even uses a code name Famous Amos
It's cheaper than a short stay at the day's inn and good like 25 cent oatmeal raisin
Give a hand to who invented the camera
Never mind the gingerbread man or the Grandma's
Shh, make sure she don't wake from her dream chill
Or get caught with a handful of cream fill

"Oh, honey! What are you doing? That's so nasty!"
It might seem ill
"Ew! Go wash your hands!"
Kookies


Goddamn it
Super motherfucking villain goddamn it
About to get these millions, stacks and shit
Yo, his dip tried to tell him
Ooh, you're like the sun
Chasing all of the rain away
When you come around, you bring brighter days
She told him
You're the perfect one
For me and you forever will be
He told her
I will rock this microphone ... always!

I hold the mic, like niggas hold their girls tight
But I ain't after her, probably your Acura pearl white
The hooker? Nah, as many times as I done hit it
To be specific more times than dimes in a briz-nick
When you broke North, I crashed the barbecue like Riddick
At the Garden, true, that's the God in me, pardon you
Jeepers! I was tore back, the ho gained access to my beeper
Called back my secretary gatekeeper
Like I ain't peep her, I said, "Darling you was stupid though
You know the Super Villain, (He is a super) ho"

I had this style ever since I was a child
I got this other style I ain't flip in a while, it goes
Pure scientific intelligence, with one point of relevance
Emcees whose styles need Velamints
And once the smoke clear, tell 'em it's
The Super motherfucking Villain, nigga came through raw like the elements
On 99 plus one of them
And with a flow to pull a fraud nigga file from out in front of him
When we with y'all, we had tons of fun
Me and my duns and them
Actual true and living sons of them
Dead planets and God-U's
Throwing divine rules to come through, we will over charge you's
Fool, and won't feel remorse for shit
Except for one time, once I had took my fronts out and lost them shits
Scientific going berserk like Red Alert
I really went to pick up wiznork for cheddar dirt
To fund these experiments is where I went
Obviously dead bent, and spent every red cent
To rule you, and still drop more jewels than schools do
Or even TV news that's designed to fool you (who?)
Yeah you, who hear the most grimy suggestions
From brothers with fly names and I.D. questions
That's a Secret like Victoria teddy sets that's edible
Them's not ready yet for the incredible
Team of MC's who broke all fakes
Who thought they were slaughter proof

Stomping through like North Face waterproof
Tat-tat, that's the end of that
After hit the bar where baby girl bartender at
I told her more wine, mingling with no single mentions of
Stay tuned for more spine tingling adventures of ...



(There's still DOOM, what of him?)
What of DOOM, my dear lady

As I stood outside your door, I heard quite a bit of your story
If you wish, I'll add mine
To clear up the mystery of DOOM's transition


feat. Pebbles the Invisible Girl
Produced By: MF DOOM


Feeel the magnetism between uuuus (The mic)
Growin in stronger and stronger (The mic)
Whyy dont we do it (The mic)

I was in a case out of state
She was thirteen and good we had a hotter date
It was just a number she never told she was knocked up
By the end of the summer chick almost had me locked up
My aunt came and got and steadied the block
We bounce to the yeti and I'm ready to rock
With no attachments feelin a little loose
Blowin up in every spot we had a little juice
Probably the Dom or the Afghani bud in me
We played the stage standin by the speaker and suddenly
Who tapped me I'm bout to get real ill
Already ripped the whole club with metal face's steel wheel (The mic)
What a sweet surprise her with the fly eyes
And fine she pulled me to the sidelines
The mystery shot up with strong words
She was an intelligent wisdom and a song bird
I met her last week at the same place
She stepped to me the same way at a no shame pace
I'm off guard her game had me choked up
Checkin me play testin me (The mic) till I spoked up
Seven whole days and nights and not a word from you (Not a word)
I was worried I thought I woulda heard from
Stranger you know I never get enough of you
How you be comin through (The mic)
Myself and two a alikes had ran through this crew of three
In my earlier days they showed me things new to me
So we knew mad brothers who they had hit off
They even used to watch each other just to rock they shit off
When slovenly two smile and I'm scopin her
Switchin off three times a night made them more opener
So you could love Allah or leave him the hell alone
Message from my god father solid gold telephone
Many of my men went up in smoke
While trickin with these chickens I ended up broke
You find out who's ya mans when you broke
Like a bad joke it's funny when you on you got mad folk
I played the middle man in every little scam
Some as complex as a hip hop album riddle jam
I find it's quite intriguing as I think about rappers
Walk upon me speaking with stinkin mouth (About what?)
About this and that from sneakers to hats to gats
Freak chicks with the cooty cat raps
And it's that ?
I'm at a black tie affair with a diva with the fatty fat
I play the back steady on the humble
But be right up front when we get ready to rumble
I gave her breath control ask her who she learned off
Coulda took her back to the crib somehow was turned off
Me and you was overdue
From gettin together baby
I always knew our love was meant to beee (The Mic)

[Pebbles-Singing]
Feel the magnetism (The Mic) between uuus (The Mic)
Growing stronger and stronger (The Mic)
Whyyy dont we do it

Good evening

Would you believe it? It’s DOOM on the phone!

What’s on your evil mind?

Hold your insulting tongue and mark my words well, I have plotted my revenge on you. Now I shall have it! Bid farewell to your friends!

DOOM hates us all, but in his warped mind, he has a personal score to settle with me

Operation Doomsday


It was back in the days when I met a brilliant student named DOOM
Hello? Anybody home?
Wow, look at that equipment
I wonder what DOOM is working on
Now I'll just rearrange a few of these circuits

What are you doing in my room?

You're even more stupid than I thought

Give me those papers

I just came by to say hello
But you'd better recheck those equations
You're off a few decimals
And that means big trouble if you use this material

Get out of here

You know when you're gonna come in?
 Nobody will never ever, ever, really, really know
Because the more you know, the more you know that you don't know shit!
Niggas'll never run out of shit!
So much shit, so much scripts through here, niggas never run out of shit...
 It's another roller coaster ride

Walk the path of Jesus, witness if Hell freezes
The mind teases reality, crack the pieces
Nothing eases; being chastise with blood baptize
Guys revise, acknowledge past lives
Statements will be made, acknowledge me
My mind is Heaven's gate so enter me
My mind is the gate to Hell, so try to flee
Both gates look the same, which will it be?
Demons scream from thought process
Enter semen, child born, stress
Body want to sleep but the mind can't rest
Measure pleasure through financial progress
When it come to currency, love is nonexistent
Foes multiply, friends become so distant
Some hope you die, backstab in an instant
Foes I despise, disguised as allies
To sabotage, camouflage
Loyalty is lies
To see God, look into my eyes
To see the Devil, then you look into my eyes
(As I rise from Hell's equator...)

Cause I'mma slow it up, speed it up, slow it up, speed it up
Metal Fingers feed beats, Grimm Reaper eat 'em up
Speed 'em up, slow 'em up, speed 'em up, slow it up
Brainsick, tick, tick, tick, MF blow it up
Slow it up, speed it up, slow it up, speed it up
Metal Fingers feed beats, Grimm Reaper eat it up
Speed it up, slow it up, speed it up, slow it up
Brainsick, tick, tick, tick, MF blow it up

Take air, compress it, bless it
Mix loops like Ku Klux
MF don't give two fucks
Nigga, quarterback blitz, popped, quickly fumble
Leave game with concussion, seeing stars and mumbles
This happens to any emcee that wants to rumble
Dynasties destroyed like Carringtons and Colbys
Noise, reduced, MF thinks in Dolby
Chop that ass in half like Obi-Wan Kenobi
Greatest of all time, God straight up told me
Greatest of all time, the Devil even told me
Icicles on surfaces of sun, we livin' coldly
Prophets be phony
And we attack, we switch like the Wu Tang symbol
Still kill Jack even though quick and nimble, plain and simple
Pick niggas off while they ballin'
And die old like Stalin
Yes, Death, I hear you callin', I accept collect
Human sacrifice, must pay respect
We catch reck, nigga, we catch reck
And... we gonna... gonna...


Boom

I remember when, last past November when
Clown kid got pounded in with the Timberlands
They left him trembling, he was not remembering:
Never tuck your denim in just to floss an emblem
Some would debate you, "Wait, the fella ate gelatin
Or he been listening in to what his weathermens was telling him"
When I could feel it in my melanin, it's compelling
Us to break them off, no reassembling
No science-fiction to no theater near you, coming soon to
Fuck with you frequently like how phases of the moon would do
You could gather 'round like it was an eclipse
Just don't look directly to the bitch, you may be blinded by the scripts

Pass the L, the last to tussle in them shirttails
All hail, King Geedorah, the third rail
700 volts holds rap to a standstill
Fool ignore the rule, fuck up and get his man killed
Two bottles of Dom got his hands filled
And so goes the days of our lives as the hourglass sand spill
And built with Passion and a glass of the 'Ze
[And the lights went down and hey!]

And I knew it was the last day ... Wig-Twisting Season
When some could get their wigs twisted back within reason
Mostly with these crimes of treason
And you'll be lucky if there's no squeezing even this evening
From how he's feeling, thrilling choice of flow is sick
He's the villain with the million dollar voice-throw trick
He's like a ventriloquist, with his fist in the speaker's back
Couldn't think of no uniquer track, nope, sneak attack
It don't really matter how big them is. So much as a nipple
Cause you could have a chick with D-Triple
'Cept the nipple little. Just hot off the griddle
Like how he do monkey rhymers, like Monkey-in-the-Middle by his damn self
Ain't no average MC ahead of me
Getting cheddar instead of the probably better pedigree
With nicknames, sick games as Rick James
Messy games, sci-fly such as Jesse James

Blast, I figure, ass-hawking ass titty licker
Last one to walk up in, fast-talking city slicker
Got bagged cause of the dirty chick with make-up
Bail out quick for the 7:30 wake-up
My only backup was an A-cup, as far as May
To when the leaves turn red and gold to Nimrod earthday
All else? Worthless to say
(And the lights went down and hey!)

That's when I knew it was the first day ... Wig-Twisting Season
When some could get their wigs twisted back within reasoning
Mostly with these crimes of treason men
And y'all be lucky if there's no squeezing even this evening

It's like a mosquito, the much sweeter resent the act
I been bent back since my Physical went back
Since, Cultured more of my kin
And for them I keep an L rolled in this hellhole
Hold your head, use your head and hold, or be dead and cold
In the worsest way, soon as the leaves show red and gold
To 'round Nimrod release day
And all else? Needless to say

Wait a motherfucking minute!! true facts presented
The names was probably changed just to protect who ain't in it
The XP was three-quarters tinted, 4/5ths was converted
The way his shit was twisted? Ask him if it hurted

... Wig-Twisting Season
When some could get their wigs twisted back within reasoning
Mostly with these crimes of lying, and fronting, and cheating
All types of different styles of treason



I'll have to go ahead with my experiment right now
Lower the dome
Are you ready Costez?

All set

My moment of triumph is at hand
Contact

It's messed up

It doesn't look bad

You're crazy, it looks bad

Okay, then at least tell me what this thing that you're doing

This figure in the middle, it’s not even coming out right
I’ve already got like the hands like on the side, like the hands of doom, and they’re like representing the city, and the environment around this artist
And he’s like, like, he’s like by himself in his own world and what not
He don’t care about nobody around him, and that’s what the hands are, everybody around him

Yeah, who is this character?
That's you

Who told, what gave, what gave you that idea?

C'mon man, I've been knowing, I've knowing for a long time that was you
Nah nah



Who you think I am, but who you want me to be?

...When I rock, jock niggas in shellshock
Don't watch the birdie watch the clock go tick tock
I rip shop, I make ya girls bottom lip drop
Yo word to the truckers at the pit stop I'm hip hop
I hold heat, never forget what niggas told me they showed me
Other emcees trying to fold me they owe me
Yo plus them niggas mad slow gee
I got my "Get U Now" so I'm comin with my homie
Here's the plan: stick 'em up, I enter, through the window
Stoop down so we can't see our crescendo
Pass the indo, yo we used to be our friend though
Yeah but thats the reason I dont really like to lend dough

From the corners cylindrical triangle hats
Says dunce. Lyrics precise like forensical science leave you entangled for months
Tryin to figure who done it, you fronted
Got cha shit stunted, didn't have to be that way
Some saw the light comin in, they shunned it
For the wickedness to those whose despise life and worship death
The established matched at eye for eye, tooth for tooth, breath to breath
These are the last days of the countdown, shit is just that drastic
Write journals, like they use the prophets, study math like a Aztec

Loved not for who you think I am, but who you want me to be
A true thuggin emcee, true thugs, with no strings attached
I wanna give you my slugs and don't wanna take em
Box sprays, but with my box cutter in my boxes
Shots sprayed, who on cops high says we rastas
Rock away boulevard, got love and ?knoxus?
Bout five cops today, my rock away
Niggas and rock rage, got paid
A rock, you know why I rock, meet me at the ?lobses?
I suggest I should dress proper
Copped a buzz, I copped a dutch
I got a lotta love, with no strings attached

Rhymes, rhymes, rhymes, we got plenty
Dimes, dimes, dimes, too many
Sparked up and chat, you keep countin
I do my thing, jealous niggas keep doubtin
Rock 'n' roll, lock 'n' load
Emcees out for pots of gold, we stop 'em cold
In they tracks an take all they chips-eses
All they dats, all they bullshit mixeses
Give 'em a credit, not debt it
We just flipped the calistetic
Toss the Andy Pettitte, you said it
We grandslam in the never boss stand
Any pussy emcee's we abandon

Flew in from Monster Island just to rag shit wit jet lag
With brothers specializin ways how us not to get bagged
Egads! I bring confusion like roll call
To emcees so-called, hoes be like "yup I told y'all"
So socialize my bio so I dip dip dive
Memorize like I-omega zip drive
Go to the bar to drink to get soberer
King Ghidra eat the head of a king cobra like ginkoba

Kong get a cut like Kobe, now hold heat
So sweet, roll deep but no beef
Those that doze deep, close sheets
Po chose to speak with, reach over to reload the piece
Slip from freak to deak, keep concrete
Parallel to body til the next male
Shotties and hotty, still waitin to exhale
Smell the blood bath a slugs caught
Slugs passed and bloodsport
Bugged laugh, a bugged thought
Caught some eyes make the case last stack a locker
Bocker, drink a vodka, hit note, like Sinatra at a opera
Drop a flocker, Orville Redenbocher
Get you, got you, shot the two L's without the proper
For the albums knocker
Hit the liquor, quicker than a quicker picker upper
Girl and stick er, I leave more nuts than a snicker
Kick er to the curb, punk a bitch, stomp a chick
For now call me Kong, Monster Isle, Monster Click (Bow!)

Loved not for who you think I am, but who you want me to be
True thuggin emcee, true thugs, with no strings attached
I wanna give you my slugs, and don't wanna take 'em back



Principal and MF DOOM:
DOOM, are you awake?
(Yes but what do you want?)
You fool, it's a miracle that you didn't kill Costez as well as yourself
So before you cause greater harm
(Get out of here
This is just a minor disappointment
I shall overcome it)

The failure of DOOM's experiment did not end his tragedy
For a few days later, his bandages were removed

DOOM and Nurse:
(Aah, how horrible, that thing)
What have I done to myself?
My face is hideous
He made me hurry my experiment
Now I must hide my face for all mankind
But he will pay, oh how he will pay

Mr. Fantastic and Commissioner Robins:
So after his face was ruined, he just seemed to disappear
(Why did DOOM threaten just to)
Well like I said he just disappeared
I'll never forgot that day




Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
(Hey!)
I'd like to thank you all for joining us this evening
Let me know if y'all with me y'all
(Hey!)
Just a couple of things I'd like to say..

I only play the games that I win at
And stay the same with more rhymes than there's ways to skin cats
As a matter of fact, let me rephrase:
With more rhymes and more ways to fillet felines these days
Watch the path of the black one:
Supervillian. He wrecks clubs for delf
In a drunken stupor chillin
Ready and willin to inadvertantly foil that
Plan of any rhymer, whiner or spoiled brat
Who got more snottier flows than snotty nose?
And holds mics like he knows karate body blows?
Nobody knows
The trouble I see
From the MPV fly dirty tailin the eye bubble eye thirty
For the record this is some shit I just thought of y'all
Science fiction that's not admissable in no court of law
I live to rock mics 3-D
The only reason I seek to stop: to snuff the TV
I heard beats, they sound like karaoke
With monkey rhymers on a leash like don't have this fairy choke me
Hit 'em with a penny so we can get these peanuts
And I thought we was nuts, I used to get free cuts
They locks Lex Luthor up in green haven
Since when a nigga never really been to clean shaven
Misbehavin rap stars need Listamint
Call me Mista Bent
I'm at where your sister went
Intelligent, used to write and be well spoke
Now all a nigga wanna do is fight and sell (HEY!), tell a joke
This could lead to catastrophe
Bout to stop the violence
Right after these last three shots from the black bat got me at headlock
Holdin on to sanity, by strands of that dreadlock
She told me get off I said:
"Bitch!!
Let me set this shit off so I could get rich right quick"
Then it hit me like the point of intoxication
Nigga come out and rock this nation like ox defacin'
A lot of niggas out is rusty like oxidation
In the world's most strangest most dangerous occupation
But you could do it, you the Super like in your building
Villian like trife Kinder is in All My Children
Plottin
And it sure to pay ends
With some real mature womens, and more of they friends
And when bad men roll tight, it's actual true
Like a pack of Big Bambú, with natural glue
Who grip necks of Becks next to triple X?
He just came in 4D: Follow the ripple effects!
And it'll lead you right to him
Oh snap!
It seems you walked into a trap, through rap
Zoinks!
This place is filled with pretender willies
One false move, and get broke off! like end of Phillies
True believers
Ain't nothin new to a
Crook with special powers like how to tell the future uh-uh-
Rhyme of the month two page long
Bustin off two gages with my cape on wrong
Son it's on remind me of a Raekwon tape song
With a fleet of super bad... Status: Rae Dawn Chong
Let me know if y'alls with me y'all!
National and geographic down to the titty-ball
Rep Monster Island City yall!
To all my brothers who is doin' unsettling bids
You could have got away with it if it was not for them
Meddl-ing kids!
(OVERR HEERRE!)




A fly tramp, that's what she called me
Cause I don't wear no Stetson hats like Paul C
As y'all see, who give a fuck? Who know what is it?
These styles will be flipped to the absolute exquisite
It's like a blizzard, soon as I got home from ATL
Looked into my baby's face, my boo was like ... "Well!
I know your types of clientele! Thoughts, needs"
As I held her firmly, yet gentle as the soft sea
She said, "The one with the horse weave? The pretty one?
All crazy, had to touch the tattoo through the short sleeve
Which one you want?" I'm like, "If there was comp?
Fuck around, a nigga like me probably run up in all three!"
King Geedorah what they call me, either caesar or baldy
Probably have moved since last y'all saw me
On the D-low, I slaughter solo emcees, they paper-thin
In they Polo, Nautica, or DK men

Amen! It's funny how significance make a difference
Notice parables of three in every other inference
For instance: "Who wanna battle? On the real?
Choose your weapon: microphone, beats, or the wheels-of-steel"
I own a crown in all three for getting down without a doubt
I'd like to give a extra special out to Jet Jaguar, the sun, moon and star

The Monster Island Czars - y'all know who you are

Get that!

Coming straight from the black lungs
I rip tracks for all players that pack guns
Stack ones in packs, done and doing back-to-back runs
To my peeps that close, so's ya' knows what's up
Y'all know the dough's quick, hoes that mess with 5-O shrimp like, "What?"
Like they wanna shmoosh us, just to packing the pushers
I'm packing gat then bust a cap at po-po
If they catch us and try to push us
Since when a MINY nigga don't be taking no shit?
I be that drug dealing nigga that be fucking ya' bitch!

What a fella! Like Salt, Pepa, Spinderella
I came to spark the deaf, dumb and blind like Helen Keller
If I'm not with George of the Jungle, if he not with Stella
Or either Priscilla, I'm doing dips on Godzilla
Though y'all know he don't play, right?
TNT throws a nigga out a moving van in broad daylight
And he was shackled by hands and feet
Then they say he tried to escape, once his face scraped the concrete
Near the curb on Monster Island, 103 Street
Where brothers run the risk of getting swallowed once the Beast eat
I'd rather lay in the cut, collect cash pay
Only TNT I see is Gilligan's castaway
With Mary Jane and Ginger
Oh, from which you spent the night by accident, I creep like a ninja
When the mack is bent, who can give one fuck?
Get bucked, get broke up like three-piece nun-chucks
Y'all sun struck, sick to they head-piece
Three-headed beast brings the drama to a dead cease

(Get that money, god)

Sick to they head-piece
(Get that money, god)

(Get that money, god)

(Get that money, god)

Greenbacks ... the meanest green stacks

Mic check...
Come through, dig the sound!
Crowd around!

I used to cop a lot
But never copped no drop
Hold mics like pony tails, tight, in 
Stop and stick around
Come through and dig the sound
Of the fly brown six-o sicko psycho who throws his dick around
Bound to go three-plat
Came to destroy rap
It's a intricate plot of a b-boy strap
[? Vemstack?] cats get kidnapped
Then release a statement to the press - let the rest know who did that
Metal Face terrorists claim responsibility
Broken household name usually said in hostility
Um... what... MF, you silly
I'd like to take "Mens to the End" for two milli'
"Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!" That's a audio daily double
Rappers need to fall off just to save me the trouble, yo
Watch your own back
Came in and go out alone, black
Stay in the zone - turn H2O to Cognac
On Doomsday!
Ever since the womb til I'm back where my brother went
That's what my tomb will say
Right above my government, Doom will lay
Either unmarked or engraved, hey, who's to say?
I wrote this one in B.C. D.C. O-section
If you don't believe me, go get bagged and check then
Cell number 17, up under the top bunk
I say this not to be mean, wish bad luck or pop junk
Pop the trunk on See-Cipher-Punk, leave him left scraped
God forbid, if there ain't no escape, blame MF tape
Definition "super-villain": a killer who love children
One who is well-skilled in destruction, as well as building
While Sidney Sheldon teaches the trife to be trifer
I'm trading science fiction with my man the live lifer
A pied piper holler a rhyme, a dollar and a dime
Do his thing, ring around the white collar crime
Get out my face, askin' about my case, need toothpaste
Fresher mint, monkey-style nigga get dentadent
And dope fiends still in they teens, sniggas turn witness
Real mens mind their own business
That's the difference between sissy-pissy rappers that's double-dutch
How come I hold the microphone double-clutch
C.O.'s make rounds, never have found
On shakedown, lock-down, wet dreams of Fox' Brown
On Doomsday!
Ever since the womb until
I'm back where my brother went
That's what my tomb will say
Right above my government, Doom will lay
Either unmarked or engraved, hey, who's to say
Doomsday
Every since the womb until
I'm back to the essence
Read it off the tomb
Either engraved or unmarked grave, who's to say
Pass the mic like "Pass the peas like they used to say"
Some M-er F-ers don't like how Sally walk
I'll tell y'all fools it's hella cool how ladies from Cali talk
Never let her interfere with the Yeti ghetto slang
Nicknames
off nipple and tip of nipples, metal fang
Known amongst hoes for the bang-bang
Known amongst foes for flow with no talking orangutangs
Only gin and Tang
Guzzled out a rusty tin can
Me and this mic is like yin and yang
Clang! Crime don't pay, listen, youth
It's like me holding up the line at the kissing booth
I took her back to the truck, she was uncouth
Spittin' all out the sunroof, through her missing tooth
But then she has a sexy voice, sound like Jazzy Joyce
So I turned it up faster than a speeding knife
Strong enough to please a wife
Able to drop today's math in the 48 keys of life
Cut the crap far as rap
Touch the mic, get the same thing a Arab will do to you for stealing
What the devil
He's on another level
It's a word! No, a name! MF - the super-villain!

Doomsday!

Dig the sound
Crowd around


Yo, yo, yo, y'all can't stand right here
In his right hand was your man's worst nightmare
Loud enough to burst his right eardrum close-range
The game is not only dangerous, but it's most strange

I sell rhymes like dimes
The one who mostly keep cash but brag about the broker times
Joking rhymes, like the "Is you just happy to see me?" trick
Classical slapstick rappers need Chapstick
A lot of 'em sound like they in a talent show
So I give 'em something to remember like the Alamo
Tally-ho! A high Joker like a Spades game
Came back from five years laying and stayed the same
I'm saying - electromagnetic field it blocks all logic, Spock
And G-Shocks her biological clock
When I hit it, slit it to the shitter, thought I killed her goose
Her Power U was pure Brita water, filtered juice
Keep a pen like a fiend keep a pipe with him
Gentleman who lent a pen to a friend who write with him
Never seen the shit again but he's still my dunny
The only thing that come between us is krill and money
I sell rhymes like dimes
The one who mostly keep cash but brag about the broke times

Better rhymes make for better songs, it matters not
If you got a lot of what it takes just to get along
Surrender now or suffer serious setbacks
Got get-back, connects wet-back, get stacks
Even if you gots to get jet-black, head to toe
To get the dough, battle for bottles of Mo' or 'dro
This fly flow take practice like Tae Bo with Billy Blanks
"Oh, you're too kind!" "Really? Thanks!"
To the gone and lost forever like "Oh My Darling Clementine"
He hold his heart when he telling rhyme
When it's his time, I hope his soul go to Heaven
He nasty like the old time Old No. 7
You still taste it when you chase it with the Coca-Cola
Make 'em wish they could erase it out the Motorola
I told her - no credit for a bag
If you want what they got, then go get it, it's all gak
Only in America could you find a way to earn a healthy buck
And still keep your attitude on self-destruct

Check it out, y'all! Ya don't stop! Keep on, to the sure shot!
Huh-ha! Uh, uh, uh, uh, oh!
Yeah, you're listening to the buttery slickness
The Land-O-Lakes from my man MF Doom!
Ha ha ha ha! Yeah!
Rock-shocking the house, with another nugget
Uh-uh-ah, eh, oh, ah, hoo-wee!
Yeah!
Regulation status, right here
Fondle 'Em Recordings, 1999
Yeah!
Now what are you 'posed to say on the end of records?
I don't know! Yeah! Woo! Yeah!
Mashed potatoes!
Apple sauce!
Buttery... biscuits!
And I get lost
A yes, yes, yes, yes y'all
You don't stop
Keep on, a' to the break-a-dawn
Say what?
Uh!
Yeah!
You thought it all was over!
You thought the song was over!
Ah! We tricked you! We tricked you!
Ha ha ha ha... Woo!
You listening to www dot hairline dot com
MF Doom, Kool Bob Love.


As the life cycle goes on ... goes on
And you learn to hold on (hold on)
To things like the mic ... the mic
And you learn to appreciate who is the nicest on said device
But who is (The finest)

Time at shashuma, too much drama, blind behind the rumor
Time and time and time, my mind, I'm trying to find a tumor
Time at shashuma, no time for humor
As soon as one of ya' men's dead in Hempstead, you trying to find Pumas
Sooner the better, even knitted a sweater already
Keep your leather, we coming through the brutal weather
We ready to do whatever, yo' Doom you with it?

(You know it like a poet, my brother)
(Hey, Gunn you wit it?) Whatever... I know about going paid to broke, to next day well-off
To bust a shell off, to dick-riders: "Get the hell off"
Made a call to a client, he must've had his cell off
A show-off, he has the same bite but fell off
I tell off the bat, from science to pure facts
Which niggas is wack 'til they last two tracks
Matter fact, y'all could wait for the rep to tell
The tall-tale, how he escape from out the depths of hell

When die, he gon' die like a soldier die:
Holding a swollen eye, drinking Olde Gold
Smoking a stog, watching po-po patrol the beach
Blowing my high, rolling by, when Gunn die
He gon' try to preach the streets then go to the sky

Yup! That hold water, like drizzle in a paper cup
This one etched in stone, the chisel with the paper up
I need a cut: a taper-up, edge-up
Niggas can't measure up, I'm here to get the treasure up

Stands up and hold 'em high, do or die
He got heat, no surprise, stop the beat, close your eyes
Got the weed, rolling lah
Not sweet, so no demise, all the guys drops seeds so multiply
Within the prophecies hold the lie

He bled my mother and my father, but can't bleed me
OD, ghetto misery, he bled my brother, my sister, but can't bleed me
A OG, ghetto misery, bled my mother, my father, but can't bleed ...

Me ... sci-fly, whole style stuck up
Used to talk to myself, I told him, "Shut the fuck up!"
Buckle up, cause it's about to be rough
He said, "Keep talking that shit, you 'bout to be snuffed"
Then we squashed it, I let em know: "Watch it --
We only met a time to join these rhymers in the mosh pit"
Gosh, it feels great just to increase the chance
For a pussy nigga face to hit the dance floor

I pull ya' top up, got clout, crack rock, what?
Now it's all good business, and so this bitch is locked up
On the dance floor: you got knocked out, your bitch got knocked up
Baby-face, and hey can you brand you, brand new machete
Damn, I just syour hand and can't stand you already
Can't stand you, understand you deadly
But my hammer's like a band, my man, it's Brand New and Heavy
Yo' Doom, you ready?

(Yeah! Yo' Gunn, you with it?) Whatever.

Come on stay, I wrote this rhyme on my born-day
Remind me of the same style I flipped on "Hey!"
Yikes! Who can fuck with the likes
Of one such who scores touchdown and spikes mic's
Metal grill, with many styles, better still
Feel like number 26 on a roulette wheel
And deal, and run rings around rhymers
And run rings like number runners whose old-timers

Shorty in the all black, she think she all that
I called her, she said, "Don't call back!"
She called me, now what you call that?
Let's go back, I sold crack
Hold gats, smoke that, drink that, toke that
Fuck! Where that ho at? Where that dough at?

Suffering succotash! This hooker broke into his last buck of cash
He love her, motherfuck her ass
Metal feet dented your car fender
My agenda up in the basement party tipping the bartender
Is unbeknownst to you -- who could get body blown?
MF like Mike Fran Corleone
And got it sown, maricon, like to know what you staring at?
An invisible cat, who pull off a disappearing act
Raised by a pack a wild womens like Sweetback
Front? I'mma be back! (Like brothers in the street act)
(Surrounded by a bunch a bad bitches like Sweetback)
(Fuck with me I'll be back)
Like niggas in the streets act (streets act!)


You know when you're gonna come in?
Nobody will never ever, ever, really, really know
Because the more you know, the more you know that you don't know shit!
Niggas'll never run out of shit!
So much shit, so much scripts through here, niggas never run out of shit...
It's another roller coaster ride

Walk the path of Jesus, witness if Hell freezes
The mind teases reality, crack the pieces
Nothing eases; being chastise with blood baptize
Guys revise, acknowledge past lives
Statements will be made, acknowledge me
My mind is Heaven's gate so enter me
My mind is the gate to Hell, so try to flee
Both gates look the same, which will it be?
Demons scream from thought process
Enter semen, child born, stress
Body want to sleep but the mind can't rest
Measure pleasure through financial progress
When it come to currency, love is nonexistent
Foes multiply, friends become so distant
Some hope you die, backstab in an instant
Foes I despise, disguised as allies
To sabotage, camouflage
Loyalty is lies
To see God, look into my eyes
To see the Devil, then you look into my eyes
(As I rise from Hell's equator...)

Cause I'mma slow it up, speed it up, slow it up, speed it up
Metal Fingers feed beats, Grimm Reaper eat 'em up
Speed 'em up, slow 'em up, speed 'em up, slow it up
Brainsick, tick, tick, tick, MF blow it up
Slow it up, speed it up, slow it up, speed it up
Metal Fingers feed beats, Grimm Reaper eat it up
Speed it up, slow it up, speed it up, slow it up
Brainsick, tick, tick, tick, MF blow it up

Take air, compress it, bless it
Mix loops like Ku Klux
MF don't give two fucks
Nigga, quarterback blitz, popped, quickly fumble
Leave game with concussion, seeing stars and mumbles
This happens to any emcee that wants to rumble
Dynasties destroyed like Carringtons and Colbys
Noise, reduced, MF thinks in Dolby
Chop that ass in half like Obi-Wan Kenobi
Greatest of all time, God straight up told me
Greatest of all time, the Devil even told me
Icicles on surfaces of sun, we livin' coldly
Prophets be phony
And we attack, we switch like the Wu Tang symbol
Still kill Jack even though quick and nimble, plain and simple
Pick niggas off while they ballin'
And die old like Stalin
Yes, Death, I hear you callin', I accept collect
Human sacrifice, must pay respect
We catch reck, nigga, we catch reck
And... we gonna... gonna...

Boom

I remember when, last past November when
Clown kid got pounded in with the Timberlands
They left him trembling, he was not remembering:
Never tuck your denim in just to floss an emblem
Some would debate you, "Wait, the fella ate gelatin
Or he been listening in to what his weathermens was telling him"
When I could feel it in my melanin, it's compelling
Us to break them off, no reassembling
No science-fiction to no theater near you, coming soon to
Fuck with you frequently like how phases of the moon would do
You could gather 'round like it was an eclipse
Just don't look directly to the bitch, you may be blinded by the scripts

Pass the L, the last to tussle in them shirttails
All hail, King Geedorah, the third rail
700 volts holds rap to a standstill
Fool ignore the rule, fuck up and get his man killed
Two bottles of Dom got his hands filled
And so goes the days of our lives as the hourglass sand spill
And built with Passion and a glass of the 'Ze

And I knew it was the last day ... Wig-Twisting Season
When some could get their wigs twisted back within reason
Mostly with these crimes of treason
And you'll be lucky if there's no squeezing even this evening
From how he's feeling, thrilling choice of flow is sick
He's the villain with the million dollar voice-throw trick
He's like a ventriloquist, with his fist in the speaker's back
Couldn't think of no uniquer track, nope, sneak attack
It don't really matter how big them is. So much as a nipple
Cause you could have a chick with D-Triple
'Cept the nipple little. Just hot off the griddle
Like how he do monkey rhymers, like Monkey-in-the-Middle by his damn self
Ain't no average MC ahead of me
Getting cheddar instead of the probably better pedigree
With nicknames, sick games as Rick James
Messy games, sci-fly such as Jesse James

Blast, I figure, ass-hawking ass titty licker
Last one to walk up in, fast-talking city slicker
Got bagged cause of the dirty chick with make-up
Bail out quick for the 7: 30 wake-up
My only backup was an A-cup, as far as May
To when the leaves turn red and gold to Nimrod earthday
All else? Worthless to say
(And the lights went down and hey!)

That's when I knew it was the first day ... Wig-Twisting Season
When some could get their wigs twisted back within reasoning
Mostly with these crimes of treason men
And y'all be lucky if there's no squeezing even this evening

It's like a mosquito, the much sweeter resent the act
I been bent back since my Physical went back
Since, Cultured more of my kin
And for them I keep an L rolled in this hellhole
Hold your head, use your head and hold, or be dead and cold
In the worsest way, soon as the leaves show red and gold
To 'round Nimrod release day
And all else? Needless to say

Wait a motherfucking minute!! true facts presented
The names was probably changed just to protect who ain't in it
The XP was three-quarters tinted, 4/5ths was converted
The way his shit was twisted? Ask him if it hurted

... Wig-Twisting Season
When some could get their wigs twisted back within reasoning
Mostly with these crimes of lying, and fronting, and cheating
All types of different styles of treason


There's only one Grim Reaper
Yes, there's only one me
Try to steal my name and fame
But they all my songs
Slap box with spirits
Knuckle it with omens
Try to bite my flowin
And your mouth be foamin
Act hard, I'll murder each one of em
Toast, roast the back of the heads
But blew brains two yards in front of em
Done with them
Now they all forgotten
Cause I pick fights the way slaves pick cotton
Grim Reaper AKA the Grinch
I've been hated for a while
On trial, mind state murder
Pre-meditated, evidence is my 12" inch
Chillin wit D, Smooth, Pac and also Vince
Murders mapped out at every measure
Bury enemies like they treasure
They give the Reaper so much pleasure
Bursting up the stacks, knapsacks and mental racks
Rhymes so crazy, Son of Sam did half my tracks
Next, I bring em
Crews, I fling them
Bring them all
I'll destroy your whole kingdom
I see all these niggas in the video
And I wonder if they individually pussy
Ain't no safety is in numbers
All big head rappers I will diss them
The world is too little
Grim Reaper run the fuckin solar system
I got mad flows, yeah you stole sum
You thought you had the cookie
But you only had the cookie crumbs
Slash throats and verbal combat
You stress your brain to the limit
Well I stress mine beyond that
Send all pawns, I roll with knights and rooks
If looks can kill, then your crew killed with looks
I battle ten men, wuts dyin', ten men
For those who scheme on, dream on like Bryan Pen-Pen
Master loose-leaf, but ryhme books tight
Not afraid to face death cause I know wut he looks like

Miscarriage, all thoughts impregnated
Abort pre-actions, dreams are terminated
Your craniums transparent, I can see right through you
Plus your speech is incoherent
Distortions of dialect communication
Now I gotta stop ya'll like communism
As you paradox, I rock solid like a prism
Since paralyzed I don't paint pretty pictures
In my lyric books, hips hop holy scriptures
Aggravated cause my spines severed, I rhyme forever
Dime a dozen phh me never
Legs can't move but in my head I dance
I wear a hobo straight jacket with a crooked pants
As yours go Blah, Blah
Mine go Blukah, Blukah
Step to me and crash mother fucka's like a sleepy trucker
If you try to front like you all that
I send you mail, but all mail sent will be black
Cause you tell lies of white, claim your right
But out of a 100% you rapper's, 99% bite
A sniper bullet derailed me, but like I said we're KMD

All hail me


Render unto Geedorah what is Geedorah's
Ten to one he sees ya through a beaker and a tweezers
Read the fine print and be like, "What's the big deal?"
Spun wheels of steel since broke wheel Big Wheel
Back when it was greasy S-curl, now it's easy dread
Had a rhyme on how they used to tease him 'bout his peasy head
Yes-yes-y'all to the beat, have it bald or Avacor
Have it your way, grab a straw, Jabberjaw
Since two tone Lee's, these new phonies is boney hoes
Lonely, like cheese and baloney only
I could've broke my "sacro-philly-ac"
Silly grind, Billy Jack, illy nine, milli black
Listen to it go "bang!" Through and through a Kangol
A strange combination of a king who use slang flow
Two-thirds slow, one-third amazing
Wonder words, fine sponsor of this Thunderbird occasion
And have an iller rhyme, at least by Miller Time
Collect the skrilla, and geese with a killer dime
Met her out in Killa Queens, originally she from the Philippines
I love the way she fill her jeans
Still a teen, and made for strange bedfellows
Okay, so it's head to elbows for shell-toes
Uh-oh, heads up! There she blows
A whole load of Head & Shoulders, and who care where she goes
Let the music take control
Just don't let the evildoers abuse it and use it to take your soul
It's like putting fire to fake gold, it turn colors
And get duller than a bake roll with no butter
The shutter of a cake hole
Who break drakes 'til it get old and flake mold
Cornball, have 'em seeing white stars, I warned y'all
Like getting hit with a bottle of Mo' from Sean Paul
"He not white" ... Oh, he mad light though
Either which way, they not ready for the lightning show
They can't scandalize mine
You could ask a swine who can't stands when I shine
Geedorah the professor, add a question to the lessons
He suggest you get a full assessment instead of guessing
It's too stressing, did he stutter like rookie yes-men?
Or did he just bring the butter, like the cookie chessmen
This just in: they ain't even worth the worry
Lying on their first birth, and couldn't even hurt a Smurf-berry
Hear ye, hear ye! How dare ye
Go up against the king who do his thing tri-yearly?
They too carefree with their mouths around here
Off with his head, and display it at Town Square
On top a seven-feet spike, make sure it's on tight
In light of when the peasants throw stones with all their might
Skull get smashed for weeks
'Til vulture beaks eats the last meat off the cheeks
Maybe then they'll know the right words to speak
Out loud, at home, in the world, or in the streets
It's no escape, just in case
All the kings' mens and 'em decides to go apes
The most slick-talking of burly guys
Get caught early and boiled in oil like curly fries
Even those that's Mr. Furley's size that earned the fate
Can all get burned at the stake
Send word to his closest kins, that for his sins
We claim his throne, his providence, and its citizens

In the name of King Geedorah!

Don't make him catch a seizure

We regret that you have not yet complied with our order
We interpret this as a negative reply
We are prepared therefore to conquer the earth

We have station King Geedorah in the Western Hemisphere
Geedorah was always one of their weapons
And King Geedorah is completely controlled by our computers through magnetic waves

Are you a homo? (Like the others)
We help thousands of homos every month!

It's in the old days right
The women knew who the women were
The women knew who the men were
The men knew who the women were
And the men knew who the men were

I'm here to tell you that the future of your planet is at stake
I urge that you transmit that message to the nations of the urge
Now do you feel like telling me where your leader is?


I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why shouldn't it be true?
I get a kick out of brew

There's only one beer left
Rappers screaming all in our ears like we're deaf
Tempt me, do a number on the label
Eat up all they MC's and drink 'em under the table like
"It's on me, Put it on my tab kid."
However you get there
Foot it, Cab it, Iron horse it
You're leaving on your face, forfeit
I crush the mic, hold it like the heat, he might toss it
Told him tell they stole it
He told her he lost it
She told him "Get off it," and a bunch other more shit
Getting money, DT's be getting no new leads
It's like he eating watermelon stay spitting new seeds
It's the weed, give me some of what he's drooping off
Soon as he wake up, choking like it was whooping cough
They group been soft
First hour at the open bar and their trooping off
He went to go laugh and get some head by the side road
She asked him to autograph her derriere
It read

"To Wide Load
This yard bird taste like fried toad Turd
Love
Villain"

Take pride in code words
Crooked eye mold nerd geek, with a cold heart
Probably still be speaking in rhymes as an old fart
Study how to eat to die, by the pizza guy
No he's not too fly to skeet in a skezzers eye
And squeeze her thigh
Maybe give her curves a feel
And the same way she feel it when she flow with nerves of steel
They call the super when they need their back... uhh... plumbing fixed
"How theres only one left? the pack comes in six
Whatever happened to two and three?"
A herb tried to slide with four and five and got caught
Like, "What you doing G?
Don't make me have to get cutting like truancy
Matter fact not for nothing right now you and me!"

Looser than a pair of Adidas
I hope you brought your spare tweeters
MC's sound like cheerleaders
Rapping and dancing like Red Head Kingpin
DOOM came do his thing again no matter who be blinging
He do it for the smelly hubbies
Seeds know what time it is, like it's time for Tellie Tubbies
Few can do it even fewer can sell it
Take it from the dude who wears mask, like a -tarded helmet
He plots shows like robberies
In and out
One, two, three, no bodies please
Run the cash and you won't get a wet sweatshirt
The mic is the shottie
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Bring heat, like ya boy done gone to war
He came in the door, and "Everybody on the floor!"
A whole string of jobs, like we on tour
Every night on the score, coming to your corner store


Mary, you make me wanna eat you
Everytime I see you, it's like the first time I meet you
Fragrance like a flower, subtle and sweet too
Seductive and whatever, it might as well be see through
Like my genie in a bottle
Miss could get me rich like a magaziney model
Before you know it, he have her on a stroll
Fresh and ripe, complexion like Acapulco Gold
If I had to guess, just right, not a day old
Like a cradle robber, copped her off, shop a trailer-load
Know the right number, you can get her
And hit it while you would've sold to the highest bidder like
Fruits and berries, bring daddy loot in a hurry
Just be cute, and don't worry
Type to make a nigga hallucinate and admit it
Then she started losing weight and letting everybody hit it

Unlike Ally (sometimes she gets bitter)
Always kept me happy, never had a problem with her
She used to let me use her, back when I was looser
Respect her until to this day and never did abuse her
I told her I'll be faithful, but she don't believe me
I probably could've been, if I'd never meet Eevee
She make me feel all fuzzy inside, it's loco
You won't get nowheres near her if you're broke though

Kept a shorty, man, find 'em much thinner
If caught I get mad time just for touching her
Knock wood, so much for hymens
So fly, she should be in the sky with diamonds
Little young thing, she liked to do the tongue thing
At times, she would play hard to get, fronting
Or something, she made me feel like the number one king
Run into her now, and we still catch a fun fling
Met her out in Central Park--that's one sign
Had the God mentally sparked, reflecting sunshine
She said "you need to stop messing with that white girl
She fucking with your head and got your heart in a tight curl"
We messed around once or twice, but she don't know me
She helped me get money at the dunce price OT
Plus she from Colombia, so she really Spanish
Cookie known to make a cat bank account vanish

And Miss Hazy, older woman, mature black
Everytime she sees me, I end up gettin towed back
All she want me to do is blaze it crazy
The only one complaint is, she make me too lazy
Sugar-mommy laced me with the butter navy Avi
Just her way to make up for the headaches that she gave me
It's all gravy, when I'm done getting my mack on
Ally is always there to help me get back on


Ooh, you're like the sun
Chasing all of the pain away
When you come around, you bring brighter days
She told me, you're the perfect one
Me and you forever will be
He told her, I will rock this microphone ... always!

I hold the mic, like niggaz hold their girls tight
But I ain't after her, probably your Acura pearl white
The hooker? Nah, as many times as I done hit it?
To be specific more times than dimes in a briz-nick
When you broke North, I crashed the barbecue like Riddick
At the Garden, true, that's the god in me, pardon you
Jeepers! I was torn back, the hoe gained access to my beeper
Call back my secretary gatekeeper
Like I ain't peep her, I said, "Darling you was stupid though
You know the Super Villain ... hoe!"

I had this style ever since I was a child
I got this other style I ain't flip in a while, it goes:
Pure scientific intelligence, with one point of relevance
MC's whose styles need Vellamints
And once the smoke clears, tell 'em it's
The Super motherfucking Villain, nigga came through raw like the elements
On 99 plus one of them
And with a flow to pull a fraud nigga file from out in front of him
When we with y'all, we had tons of fun
Me and my duns and them
Actual true and living sons of them
Dead planets and God-U's
Throwing divine rules to come through, we will over charge you's
Fool, and won't feel remorse for shit
Except for one time, once I had took my fronts out and lost them shits
Scientific gone bezerk like Red Alert
I really wanted to pick up was [?] for cheddar dirt
The funniest experiments is where I went
Obviously dead bent, and spent every red cent
To rule you, and still drop more jewels than schools do
Or even TV news that's designed to fool you (who?)
Yeah you, who hear the most grimy suggestions
From brothers with fly names and I.D. questions
That's a Secret like Victoria teddy sets that's edible
Them's not ready yet for the incredible
Team of MC's who broke off fakes
Who thought they were slaughta proof

Stomping through like North Face waterproof
Tat-tat, at the end of that
After hit the bar where baby girl bartender at
I told her more wine, mingling with no single mentions of
Stay tuned for more spine tingling adventures of ... 


We do not have the lyrics for Go with the Drawls (Live) yet.


We do not have the lyrics for Gas Flows (Live) yet.


I only play the games that I win at
And stay the same with more rhymes than there's ways to skin cats
As a matter of fact, let me rephrase
With more rhymes and more ways to fillet felines these days
Watch the path of the black one
Supervillian he wrecks clubs for dell
In a drunken stupor chillin
Ready and willin to inadvertantly foil that plan of any rhymer, whiner or
spoiled brat
Who got more snottier flows than snotty nose?
And holds mics like he knows karate body blows
Nobody knows the trouble I see
from the MPB fly dirty tailin the eye bubble eye thirty
For the record this is some shit I just thought of y'all
Science fiction that's not admissable in no court of law
I live to rock mics 3-D
The only reason I seek to stop to snuff the TV
I heard beats, they sound like karaoke
With monkey rhymers on a leash like don't have this fairy choke me
Hit 'em with a penny so we can get these peanuts
And I thought we was nuts, I used to get free cuts
They locks Lex Luthor up in green haven
Since when a nigga never really been to clean shaven
Misbehavin rap stars need mistament
Call me Mista Bent
I'm at where your sister went
Intelligent, used to write and be well spoke
Now all a nigga wanna do is fight and sell, tell a joke
This could lead to catastrophe
Bout to stop the violence right after these last three shots from the black
bat got me at headlock
Holdin on to sanity while stranded at dreadlock
She told me get off I said
Bitch, let me set this shit off so I could get rich right quick
Then it hit me like the point of intoxication
Nigga come out and rock this nation like oxifacen
A lot of niggas out is rusty like oxidation
In the world's most strangest most dangerous occupation
But you could do it, you the Super like in your building
Villian like trife kingdom wear and all my children
Plottin and it sure to pay ends
With some more mature womens and more of they friends
And when bad men roll tight, it's actual true
Like a pack of big bamboo with natural glue
Who grip necks of becks next to triple X
He just came before D followed the ripple effects
And it'll lead you right to him
Oh snap, it seems you walked into a trap do wrap
Zoinks, this place is filled with pretender willies
One false move and get broke off like end of phillies
True believers ain't nothin new to a
Crook with special powers like how to tell the future uh uh
Rhyme of the month two page long
Bustin off two gages with my cake gone wrong
Son it's on remind me of a Raekwon tape song
With a fleet of super bad status Rae Dawn Chong
Let me know if y'alls with me y'all
Nasty yo and geographic down to the titty bar
Rap monster outer city y'all
To all my brothers who is doin' unsettling bids
You could have got away with it if it was not for them meddling kids 



Living off borrowed time, the clock tick faster
That'd be the hour they knock the slick blaster
Dick Dastardly and Muttley with sick laughter
A gun fight and they come to cut the mixmaster
I-C-E cold, nice to be old
Y2G stee twice to threefold
He sold scrolls, lo and behold
Know who's the illest ever like the greatest story told
Keep your glory, gold and glitter
For half, half of his niggas'll take him out the picture
The other half is rich and it don't mean shit-ta
Villain: a mixture between both with a twist of liquor
Chase it with more beer, taste it like truth or dare
When he have the mic, it's like the place get like: "Aw yeah!"
It's like they know what's 'bout to happen
Just keep ya eye out, like "Aye, aye captain"
Is he still a fly guy clapping if nobody ain't hear it
And can they testify from in the spirit
In living, the true gods
Giving y'all nothing but the lick like two broads
Got more lyrics than the church got "Ooh Lords"
And he hold the mic and your attention like two swords
Or even one with two blades on it
Hey you, don't touch the mic like it's AIDS on it
It's like the end to the means
Fucked type of message that sends to the fiends
That's why he brings his own needles
And get more cheese than Doritos, Cheetos or Fritos
Slip like Freudian
Your first and last step to playing yourself like accordion

When he had the mic you don't go next
Leaving pussy cats like why hoes need Kotex
Exercise index, won't need Bowflex
And won't take the one with no skinny legs like Joe Tex


Villain get the money like curls
They just trying to get a nut like squirrels, in his mad world
Land of milk and honey with the swirls
Where reckless naked girls get necklaces and pearls
Compliments of the town jeweler
Left back now schooler, trying to sound cooler
On the microphone known as the crown ruler
Never lied to ma when we said we found the moolah

Five-hundred something dollars laying, right there in the street
Huh, now let's try and get something to eat
Then he turned four and started flowing to the poor
That's about when he first started going raw
Kept the 'dro in the drawer
A rhyming klepto who couldn't go up in the store no more
His life is like a folklore legend

Why are you so stiff? You need to smoke more brethren
Instead of trying to riff with the broke war veteran
Spliff made him swore he saw Heaven, he was seven
Yup, you know it, growing up too fast
Showing up to class with Mo't in a flask
He ask the teacher if he leave will he pass
His girl is home alone he trying to get the

If you want to sip get a paper water fountain glass
How I'm 'posed to know where your mouth been last?
Hands so fast he can out-spin the Flash
Known to smoke a whole mountain of hash, to the ash
Boom-bash, leave the room with the stash
Assume it's in a smash, Doom get the cash



It never really mattered too much to me
That I was just too damn old to emcee
All that really matters is if your rhymes was ill
Girl, that's all that really mattered to me, oh baby

Looks like it's gonna be a great day today
To get some fresh air like a stray on a straightaway
Hey you, got a light? Nah, a Bud Light
Early in the morning, face crud from like a mud fight
Lookie here, it's just the way the cookie tear
Prepare to get hurt and mangled like Kurt Angle rookie year
The rocket scientist, with the pocket wine list
Some even say he might need some p-sychiatrist
DOOM, are you pondering what I'm pondering?
Yes, but why would the darn thing be wandering?
She's like a foundling, barely worth fondling
My posse's on Broadway like Mama I Want to Sing
Mad plays the bass like the race card
Villain on the case to break shards and leave her face scarred
Groovy, dude! Not to prove to be rude
But this stuff is like what you might put on movie food
Uh, what is jalapeños?
Get it like a whuppin' when you holla at your seniors
Dolla he can overhear the hashish vena
He just came from over there, the grass is greener
Last wish: I wish I had two more wishes
And I wish they fixed the door to the matrix, there's mad glitches
Spit so many verses sometimes my jaw twitches
One thing this party could use is more... booze
Put yourself in your own shoes
And stay away from all those pairs of busted Timbs you don't use
He only keep 'em to decorate
If you wanna peep him, select a date
And bring a deep check, like "Check, mate"
I kid you not, on the dotted line signed
Ever since a minor, kids considered him some kind of Einstein
On a diamond mine grind, she was dumb fine
But not quite the type that you might want to wine and dine
Couldn't find a pen, had to think of a new trick
This one he wrote in cold blood with a toothpick
On second thought, it's too thick
His assistant said: "Doom, you sick," he said "True" through acoustics
Psycho, his flow is drowned in Lawry's seasoning
With micropower he's sound and right reasoning
It's easy as pi, 3.14
One more one false move and they're done for





Yo, yo, yo, y'all can't stand right here
In his right hand was your man's worst nightmare
Loud enough to burst his right eardrum close-range
The game is not only dangerous, but it's most strange

I sell rhymes like dimes
The one who mostly keep cash but brag about the broker times
Joking rhymes, like the "Is you just happy to see me?" trick
Classical slapstick rappers need Chapstick
A lot of 'em sound like they in a talent show
So I give 'em something to remember like the Alamo
Tally-ho! A high Joker like a Spades game
Came back from five years laying and stayed the same
I'm saying - electromagnetic field it blocks all logic,Spock
And G-Shocks her biological clock
When I hit it, slit it to the shitter, thought I killed her goose
Her Power U was pure Brita water, filtered juice
Keep a pen like a fiend keep a pipe with him
Gentleman who lent a pen to a friend who write with him
Never seen the shit again but he's still my dunny
The only thing that come between us is krill and money
I sell rhymes like dimes
The one who mostly keep cash but brag about the broke times

Better rhymes make for better songs, it matters not
If you got a lot of what it takes just to get along
Surrender now or suffer serious setbacks
Got get-back, connects wet-back, get stacks
Even if you gots to get jet-black, head to toe
To get the dough, battle for bottles of Mo' or 'dro
This fly flow take practice like Tae Bo with Billy Blanks
"Oh, you're too kind!" "Really? Thanks!"
To the gone and lost forever like "Oh My Darling Clementine"
He hold his heart when he telling rhyme
When it's his time, I hope his soul go to Heaven
He nasty like the old time Old No. 7
You still taste it when you chase it with the Coca-Cola
Make 'em wish they could erase it out the Motorola
I told her - no credit for a bag
If you want what they got, then go get it, it's all gak
Only in America could you find a way to earn a healthy buck
And still keep your attitude on self-destruct


Check it out, y'all! Ya don't stop! Keep on, to the sure shot!
Huh-ha! Uh, uh, uh, uh, oh!
Yeah, you're listening to the buttery slickness
The Land-O-Lakes from my man MF Doom!
Ha ha ha ha! Yeah!
Rock-shocking the house, with another nugget
Uh-uh-ah, eh, oh, ah, hoo-wee!
Yeah!
Regulation status, right here
Fondle 'Em Recordings, 1999
Yeah!
Now what are you 'posed to say on the end of records?
I don't know! Yeah! Woo! Yeah!
Mashed potatoes!
Apple sauce!
Buttery... biscuits!
And I get lost
A yes, yes, yes, yes y'all
You don't stop
Keep on, a' to the break-a-dawn
Say what?
Uh!
Yeah!
You thought it all was over!
You thought the song was over!
Ah! We tricked you! We tricked you!
Ha ha ha ha... Woo!
You listening to www dot hairline dot com
MF Doom, Cool Bob Love...




Tossing, turning, dreams of murder, someone's killing me
Of changes, there's nights I'm on a killing spree
All done cold blood waking up in cold sweats
This is such a cold world unconscious getting death threats
Shadows choking me, my last breath lets out my body
It's a conspiracy, my mind and my body's not really down with me
Me against the whole world? It's a little deeper
Me against my self, I fight the Grim Reaper
Swing sickle, I got my Glock bust rounds off
Demented, schizophrenic, I know this sounds off to you
I do not lie, when I doze off spirits hope I die, whatever
Angels waste the time, they work together
Scheme and plot on me, cause I'm the son of man
I hear voices from a dog like Son of Sam
Don't give a damn if the bullets fill me
I don't wanna live, I hope they kill me
Put me out my misery, I live in misery
I kill all my enemies, cause I love company
Those who seek me, are called wise men
Or either wise-guys I pray you comprehend
And realize I'm condemned

No rest, homicidal dreams
My cellmate, all he do is scream
Out loud how he wants to go home
That's funny, I'm here all alone
Locked, in a single cell
His back's bleeding, he's cold as hell
And I'm hoping, they turn on some heat
I call the C.O. to bring some extra sheets
"Where'd he go?" he walk through walls, run halls, I pray "teach me"
They don't see him at the health they try to reach me
I said "please see how he feels"
They said, "He's alright but he's not real"
Evaluations say I suffer from depression
Hallucinations, self-creations what they're guessin'
I'm here doing years, I'm stressin'
Medicate me, sedate me want me to rest an'
Don't take it cause he said that won't be best an'
He said I need his help and he needs me
"Nigga you walk through walls, go home you're free"

Home, that was far and he was turned off
Cause his wings was burned off
A lesson was learned, communicate with one
I was chosen cause I'm God's son

And I'm the retarded one!
(*sings*) Out in the streets
You won't survive with, wack-ass beats ("We can see that!")
These days and times
Watch as we get ours with rhymes

To my Metal Face bros with stomachs of cast-iron
Who been in to win and blast to the last siren
On the slow-mo the calm artist with the so-so chick
Chased them all like how he did to Slobodan Milosovik
Anyhoo, how 'bout them Yankees?
Once I leave off-stage the party people thanks mee's
If I may speak freely nasty like the freaky-deeky
At your local sleazy speak-easy
For any fan of the limelight
In the mic stand was left a lit stick of dynamite
It's risky business like hand-to-hand crack sale
With rappers who's better off on the cover of Black Tail
Jumpin Jehosaphat, who's that?
Who cats who do magic be like "tell me how you do's that"
Heck no, especially those who cop pleas like gecko
Thought I might do techno
Ha ha, betcha bust out laughing at the bet
For no reason he get cussed out like Tourettes
Yet tight flow to make her bad-ass stutter
Or even crack a smile from a mad fast cutter
Butter, word play since third grade age
Back when we used to play "Bang! Open bird cage"
Hip hop Benny Hill's sip Henny straight, get every penny weighed, then he chill, at any rate
My metal-face hoes with tongue or (at) least eye ring
Do yourself, I will continue to do my thing
Like Kung-Fu fighting everybody was biting
And the super-villain strike again like lightning
In the same spot (bzzz!) now what's the chance of that?
And a name-drop like pick the name out the hat
That's a no jiver from the, liver conniver
Who vote players out the rap game like Survivor while I
Drop through greens like a nerd cat with intended speech from way back
And spin on your back and then freeze
While I play high-ball, low-ball, to zero
So called rhymers, go call Cleo
While I, steal the show like thought-so-try-hiking
Super-duper stars need Ortho-TriCylin
Sometimes the men, mostly from the women
I hear voices saying that's the super-villain
(Uhh, I hear voices)
Mostly from the women, I hear voices... super-villain


What a niggy know
Yo a niggy know the game
What a niggy name, black?
X like the flick slick
What a niggy clique be?
The Kause, CM crew
What a niggy do?

Let the monkey out the zoo
It's on my back now repeat I'm the X
A biggy not a bigot pass the 40 man I'm tempted to swig
Save shit for after the gig ya dig?
Buds like figs pick out sticks and twigs
Like Sub picks out wigs, I jigs like a shank
Zev Love X I be sex like swank
So crank up the cuts and get some ups on the Ziggy-ziggy
I gots ta gots ta rock the mic and grab my niggy-niggy (Nuts!)
One two, sound off chumsy
Finna flip the script like roundoff summy
Yummy to the tooth, bitter to the tummy
Help keeps that monkey shit constipated for me jimmy jimmy rummy
Now where my money at fat?
Livin like that Ziggy from the funnies cat, yeah
We both be in the papers
Me from pullin capers with the gatt it's like that

What a niggy know?
Your ho, she know why
What a niggy go by?
Dead roach, no joke
What a niggy smoke kid?
Nothin but the raw spots
What a niggy got?

Bis-a-busy is a what I get props yo I gets more
Stick 'em up a niggy boxed cause I gets raw
Lots of many many plenty of leeway
Subroc AKA Kingilizwe
Cock-a-doodle-do with the head up y'all
Like a quadruple fat goose I, swell up child
See ya diaper that leaves a soggy
I'll bungee jump kick ya butt like Miyagi
No curls, no braids but steel wool
With my ill style mad Gs I pull
I lay lower than a limbo stick
Follow me quick, or leave alone a jimbo stick
Can ya dig it? I roll rugged
Clock me dumb and my nigga will fly that nugget
To the drum y'all
Stung I caught y'all
I shadowbox that ass and teleport y'all
A yesh yesh y'alls

Like this y'all, like that y'all, to the beat y'all!
Like that y'all, to the beat y'all, yes yes y'all

To the beat y'all, like that y'all, to the beat y'all

Check it!
I'm the one hun if ya checkin for the rhyme
Some for any party turn my hat back then mic check two
Ninety three for the time, c'mon everybody let's rock that
That, that, UUNGH, niggas shoulda known it
If I chase the cat I'mma bone it doggone it
And good riddance
I keep my funky mittens off them kittens and I don't quit
But if I catch the AIDS I'll be quittin the bullshittin
The chicken crossed the street cause he seen me with a mask
Knockin over trash cans and mail boxes on my block (KA-BLAOW!)
Sounded like a roc roc y'all

Like that y'all, to the beat y'all, yes yes y'all
Like that y'all, like that y'all, to the beat y'all
Yes yes y'all, like this y'all, yes yes y'all

Like this y'all, like that y'all, to the beat!

...Ya black bastard!
