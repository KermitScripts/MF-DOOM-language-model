Unlike everyone else the first thing I asked ChatGPT to do was to come up with a song in the style of rapper MF DOOM. I knew if it could do this then I really should be re-training as a joiner. Needless to say it did a bad job, this is what it came up with:
I'm MF DOOM, the villainous one
Hiding behind a metal mask, my face is never shown
I spit rhymes like bullets, sharp and deadly
Leaving my competition in the dust, already

I'm a mastermind, a lyrical genius
I don't follow trends, I set them, see this
I'm a master of wordplay, my flow is untouchable
I leave my foes in the dirt, they're not fit to battle

I'm the king of the underground, no one can bring me down
I reign supreme, I wear the crown
I'm the doom bringer, the one and only
I'm MF DOOM, the legendary MC

Here is an example of the sort of word play MF DOOM is known for:
...what up?
To all rappers, shut up.
While you shutting up, keep a shirt on,
At least a button up. Yuck... Is they rhymers or stripping males?
Outta work jerks, since they shut down chippendales.
Chipping nails,
DOOM - tipping scales,
Let alone the preorders, that's counted off shipping sales,
This one goes out to all my people skipping bail,
Dipping jail, whipping tail, and sipping ale.

As you can see ChatGPT is more than a long way so i thought I would try my luck by traning a GPT specifically on as many of his lyrics I can get my hands on. The script scrapeLysrics does what it says on the tin, scrape lyrics off the internet and put them into a text file, lyrics.txt contains all the lyrics if you want to skip straight to traning. 

Discalimer:
Obviosly I intend to not publish any AI songs based off of MF DOOM this was just a bit of fun, if anyone feels deeply offended I can just retrain the model on Drake lyrics.
